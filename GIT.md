# Git Repositories

1. GitHub
1. GitLab
1. BitBucket

I'm not going to cover Git commands in this file. You should already know that your public repositories may be open to contrinutors. This is going to cover the collaboration aspects other the the project files

## GitHub

LINKS:

- Check all the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en) and also check my [Beginner Git Commands](https://github.com/Kernix13/beginner-git-commands) repo.

Communication on GitHub is done with comments in Issues and in Pull Requests. But the Discussions tab is where fill-blown conversations can take place while on GitHub. It would probably be better to discuss topics in Discord or Slack, unless you would want a record of the discussions and the paths taken as a result.
