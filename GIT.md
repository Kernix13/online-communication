I'm not going to cover Git commands in this file. You should already know that your public repositories are open to contributors. This is going to cover the collaboration aspects other the the project files or the git commands. You are viewing this on GitHub after all!

For GitLab and BitBucket, I am only going to add notes about communicating.

## GitHub

LINKS:

- Check all the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en) and also check my [Beginner Git Commands](https://github.com/Kernix13/beginner-git-commands) repo.

Communication on GitHub is done with

1. Comments in Issues and in
1. Pull Requests
1. The Discussions tab is where full conversations can take place. It would probably be better to discuss topics in Discord or Slack, unless you would want a record of the discussions and the paths taken as a result.

## GitLab

#### Plan your work in projects

- Your work takes place in a project, from creating code, to planning, collaborating, and more.

#### Work with a self-managed instance

- If you’re an administrator of a self-managed instance of GitLab, these tutorials can help you manage and configure your instance
- [Get started administering GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/get_started.html): Configure your organization and its authentication, then secure, monitor, and back up GitLab.

#### Integrate with GitLab

- GitLab integrates with a number of third-party services, enabling you to work with those services directly from GitLab.
- [Integrate with Jira](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/04/12/gitlab-jira-integration-selfmanaged/?_gl=1*m4uknh*_ga*OTY3NjYxODI2LjE2NjI0MDM0NTQ.*_ga_ENFH3X7M5Y*MTY2NDIyOTkzNy41LjAuMTY2NDIyOTkzNy4wLjAuMA..): Configure the Jira integration, so you can work with Jira issues from GitLab.

> The free plan includes 5GB storage, 10GB transfer per month, 400 CI/CD minutes per month, and five users per namespace.

The beauty of GitLab is that it allows all team members to collaborate in all phases of a project. The platform provides both free open and private repositories, issue-following features, and wikis. It enables teams to collaborate on project tasks, from the early planning stages to software launches and monitoring.

#### GitLab Basics

- The platform enables planning and management through epics, milestones, and groups, allowing teams to organize and track project progress
- The platform helps you plan, organize, align, and then track project work to ensure all team members are working on the right tasks
- You can manage and optimize team performance and the software delivery lifecycle with metrics to streamline processes and increase the frequency of software releases

#### Hosting & Installing

- Many prefer to use GitLab in Linux, as GitLab software is custom-made for the open-source operating system and is mature and scalable.
- You can install GitLab on Windows, but there are some restrictions.
- To get around this, you can install GitLab Runner

#### How to use GitLab

</h3>

GitLab is a web-based Git repository that provides free open and private repositories, issue-following capabilities, and wikis. It is a complete DevOps platform that enables professionals to perform all the tasks in a project—from project planning and source code management to monitoring and security. Additionally, it allows teams to collaborate and build better software.

GitLab helps teams reduce product lifecycles and increase productivity, which in turn creates value for customers. The application doesn't require users to manage authorizations for each tool. If permissions are set once, then everyone in the organization has access to every component.

Customers can opt for the paid version of GitLab if they want to access more functionalities.

#### Why Use GitLab

The main benefit of using GitLab is that it allows all the team members to collaborate in every phase of the project. GitLab offers tracking from planning to creation to help developers automate the entire DevOps lifecycle and achieve the best possible results.

- It allows powerful CI/CD pipelines
- It has an in-built registry that can be deployed instantly without any configurations
- It can be perfectly integrated with Kubernetes
- It can import enormous projects and also export other codes in the project

#### GitLab Advantages

GitLab Offers several critical advantages for developers. Here are some of the most important advantages of Gitlab:

- Very easy to set up
- User-friendly UI and tools
- Allows an unlimited number of free private repositories
- Can integrate many APIs and third-party services
- Has very reliable uptime

#### GitLab Disadvantages

Of course, like any other tool available today, GitLab comes with its own share of disadvantages such as:

- The UI can be a bit complicated for reviewing
- The tool itself has a few bugs which can make it a bit sloppy

Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system that allows developers to handle everything from small to very large projects with top speed and efficiency. Its goals include data integrity, speed, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows, which essentially means multiple people can work together on the same code without hindering the other’s progress.

#### Basic sections in the article

I'm skipping the following sections because they are basic:

1. Sign Into Your Account
2. Create Your First GitLab
3. Open a Git Bash and Configure a GitProject
4. Create a Project Folder or Directory to Initialize Git
5. Create an Example Text File
6. Add the File to Staging and Commit the Changes
7. Push Local Changes to the Remote Repository

- A Handy List of Git Commands

#### Common Problems When Using GitLab

Saying Git is complex is an understatement. So when you’re brand-new to the world of Git, you are bound to make mistakes. In this section, we’ll cover the six common Git mistakes, as well as solutions to help you fix them.

_Problem #1: Spelled that Last Commit Message Wrong_:

When working on a code for a considerable amount of time, you start making spelling mistakes. If you spell your last comment message wrong, all you need to do is enter the following command:

- Solution: `git commit –amend`
- That will open up the editor, allowing you to make the required changes to your last commit message.

_Problem #2: Add a File to Your Last Commit_:

You missed a file, forgot to save it, or perhaps have to make a minor change to the last commit. After adding that missed file, run the command. It should look something like this:

```bash
git add missed-file.txt
git commit –amend
```

At this stage, you can either amend the commit message or save it to retain the message.

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

_Problem #3: Committing the Changes to the Master Branch_:

Imagine you’re working on a new feature, but you forget to open a new branch for it. In your haste, you ended up already committing a lot of files that are now sitting on the master branch.

GitLab can stop you from pushing directly to the master branch. In this case, however, you can roll back all the changes to a new branch by entering the following three commands:

```bash
git branch future-brunch
git reset HEAD~ –hard
git checkout future-brunch
```

Applying the above command will create a new branch, roll back the master branch to where it was before you committed the changes, and then provide you a new branch with all your previous changes.

**Note**: Be sure to commit or stash all your changes first. Otherwise, you will lose all your progress.

_Problem #4: Misspelling Your Branch Name_:

You can rename your branch in the same way you rename a file with the `mv` command, which involves moving the branch to a new location with the correct name. Like this:

`git branch -m future-brunch feature-branch`

If you already pushed the branch, you’ll have to carry out a few extra steps. First, you will have to delete the old branch from the remote and then push up a new one.

```bash
git push origin –delete future-brunch
git push origin feature-branch
```

_Problem #5: Removing the File You Mistakenly Added to Your Repository_:

Regardless of whether you add a rogue ENV file, a personal picture, or a build directory, it’s all fixable.

If you simply staged the file and didn’t commit yet, you can reset that staged file by using the following command:

`git reset /assets/img/misty-and-pepper.jpg`

On the other hand, if you have already committed that change, you’ll have to run an extra step before. It’ll go like this:

```bash
git reset –soft HEAD~1
git reset /assets/img/misty-and-pepper.jpg
rm /assets/img/misty-and-pepper.jpg
git commit
```

Applying the above command will undo the commit, remove the image, and then add a new commit in its place.

### My GitLab notes

**TERMS**:

- _Project_: is a Git repository that has built-in CI/CD functtionality, issue tracking, collaboration tools, or just a "repo".
- _Member_: Users or groups that have access to a GitLab project/repo. The members have roles which have permissions.
- _Merge Requests_: Request to merge a branch into another branch, so like Pull Requests.
- _Issue_: Same as issues on GitHub

#### Common Problems When Using Bitbucket

Although Bitbucket is a strong software program, developers will encounter some challenges when using it.

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

_Problem 1: Limited Users in Public Repositories_:

- Bitbucket limits the number of contributors you can place in public repositories. This can cause issues when trying to allow a large team to collaborate on an open-source development project.
- Bitbucket works better for those who want to run projects in private repositories. It also works better for small and medium-sized businesses that have small teams working on projects together rather than huge groups of people.
- If you truly need a Git interface software package that works well for large open-source development projects, you may want to consider subscribing to a Bitbucket competitor, such as GitHub.

_Problem 2: Interface Is Challenging to Use_:

- Some Bitbucket users find the software’s interface to be difficult to use. The interface’s design seems older, and some users describe it as clunky. Because of the challenging interface, some people who are new to the Bitbucket software may feel as though the software is running slow and they are struggling to complete projects.
- The best way to work around this problem is to spend time with Bitbucket. The longer you work with Bitbucket’s interface, the better results you should have.

_Problem 3: Limited Functionality for Creating and Tracking Bug Issues_:

- Each Bitbucket repository includes an issue tracker. You can use this feature to track bug reports and feature requests for the project. However, Bitbucket keeps its built-in bug tracking feature simplistic, not wanting to bog users down with complexities.
- For those needing a higher level of functionality in bug tracking features, Bitbucket will integrate closely with Jira, a project management software tool specializing in tracking bugs. (Atlassian owns both Bitbucket and Jira.) Creating an integration between Bitbucket and Jira is an easy process, and it will yield advanced features for tracking bug issues.

_Problem 4: Sluggish Performance Issues in Bitbucket_:

- One of the most common complaints from Bitbucket users involves the sluggishness of the software in certain circumstances.
- For example, if you are experiencing delays while waiting for the merging of pull requests, understand that the merging will occur in the background. You can continue working and even navigate away from the screen to perform other tasks while the merger continues in the background.
- Large projects tend to have more frequent issues with sluggish performance than smaller projects that involve fewer people. If you have the opportunity to break up a larger project into small chunks, you may be able to work around some of the sluggish performance issues.
- Those who find that Bitbucket runs too slowly for their needs also have the option of switching to a software package like GitHub, which tends to work better for large organizations and tends to avoid sluggish performance.

#### Bitbucket Integration With Jira

Jira is a tool to plan and track the tasks assigned to the project teams. Usually, teams do work on the tasks assigned to them. So if you look at it from an Agile point of view, the teams work with issues like Epic, Story, Tasks, and Bugs that are assigned to them in Jira.

1. Teams need to ensure that any source code changes are traced or linked to the Task/Bug assigned to them to enable transparency of the work done
1. Log in to Bitbucket as Admin user and go to the Administration -> Application links. Add the URL of Jira which will then add a reciprocal link in Jira as well
1. Add the URL and click on Create new Link. A reciprocal link is also created in Jira by which both the tools are now ready to be integrated
1. Now perform a code change and commit the code, Push the changes to the repository. While committing the code mention the Jira issue id in the comments
1. Now, look at the issue in Jira to see the link to the code change under the Development section
1. Click on the Commit Id and you should see the changes done

#### Delete Repository

1. To delete a Bitbucket repository click on the repository to be deleted and go to the Repository settings option
1. Click on the button Delete Repository on the right-hand side
1. Note: You will need to have Bitbucket Admin privileges to delete any repository. A normal Bitbucket user will not have the permissions. A Bitbucket Admin can set the user permissions from Settings -> Global Permissions

Bitbucket is our Git repository management solution designed for professional teams. It gives you a central place to manage git repositories, collaborate on your source code and guide you through the development flow.

Bitbucket provides lot’s of features that include the deployment of Bitbucket is made in three different options: Bitbucket cloud, Bitbucket data center, and Bitbucket Server.

It’s used in access control, pull request, workflow control, integration of Jira, full rest API. The restriction of source code is provided by Bitbucket, which has access control.

#### How to use BitBucket step by step

1. To start the Version control system Project in Bitbucket, we need to create a project and then it groups several repositories. Log into BitBucket and click on create Project present in the Project tab.
1. After creating the Project, click on the “+” symbol to create a repository.
1. After creating a new repository, we have to follow the below instructions to clone the Git repository to a local machine.
1. In the repository, click the clone button, and then BitBucket shows clone this repository dialog.
1. Copy the clone command and then select the directory where you want to clone the repository.
1. After that, we should create a branch. For creating a branch, we will click on the branches button, and we will see one branch called “Master” is active. Click on the Create branch present in the right side corner.
1. Make some changes in the branch as per your requirement.

#### Feature and Advantage of using BitBucket

- Is absolutely more flexible – with access to a wider range of version control systems.
- Has a powerful Jira integration – to make task tracking simple.
- Has a powerful Trello integration.
- Arguably has better pricing, depending on your needs.
