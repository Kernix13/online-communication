I'm not going to cover Git commands in this file. You should already know that your public repositories are open to contributors. This is going to cover the collaboration aspects other the the project files or the git commands. You are viewing this on GitHub after all!

For GitLab and BitBucket, I am only going to add notes about communicating.

## GitHub

LINKS:

- Check all the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en) and also check my [Beginner Git Commands](https://github.com/Kernix13/beginner-git-commands) repo.

Communication on GitHub is done with

1. Comments in Issues and in
1. Pull Requests
1. The Discussions tab is where full conversations can take place. It would probably be better to discuss topics in Discord or Slack, unless you would want a record of the discussions and the paths taken as a result.

> The free plan includes 5GB storage, 10GB transfer per month, 400 CI/CD minutes per month, and five users per namespace.

The beauty of GitLab is that it allows all team members to collaborate in all phases of a project. The platform provides both free open and private repositories, issue-following features, and wikis. It enables teams to collaborate on project tasks, from the early planning stages to software launches and monitoring.

#### GitLab Basics

- The platform enables planning and management through epics, milestones, and groups, allowing teams to organize and track project progress
- The platform helps you plan, organize, align, and then track project work to ensure all team members are working on the right tasks
- You can manage and optimize team performance and the software delivery lifecycle with metrics to streamline processes and increase the frequency of software releases

#### Hosting & Installing

- Many prefer to use GitLab in Linux, as GitLab software is custom-made for the open-source operating system and is mature and scalable.
- You can install GitLab on Windows, but there are some restrictions.
- To get around this, you can install GitLab Runner

#### How to use GitLab

Here are the sub-section titles for this section, which I am skipping:

- How to create a project
- How to create a project from a template
- How to create a group
- Project forking workflow

GitLab is a web-based Git repository that provides free open and private repositories, issue-following capabilities, and wikis. It is a complete DevOps platform that enables professionals to perform all the tasks in a project—from project planning and source code management to monitoring and security. Additionally, it allows teams to collaborate and build better software.

GitLab helps teams reduce product lifecycles and increase productivity, which in turn creates value for customers. The application doesn't require users to manage authorizations for each tool. If permissions are set once, then everyone in the organization has access to every component.

Customers can opt for the paid version of GitLab if they want to access more functionalities.

#### Why Use GitLab

The main benefit of using GitLab is that it allows all the team members to collaborate in every phase of the project. GitLab offers tracking from planning to creation to help developers automate the entire DevOps lifecycle and achieve the best possible results.

#### GitLab Features

GitLab has a rich reserve of Git repository along with several additional features. Here are some of the key features of GitLab:

- It allows powerful CI/CD pipelines
- It has an in-built registry that can be deployed instantly without any configurations
- It can be perfectly integrated with Kubernetes
- It can import enormous projects and also export other codes in the project

#### GitLab Advantages

GitLab Offers several critical advantages for developers. Here are some of the most important advantages of Gitlab:

- Very easy to set up
- User-friendly UI and tools
- Allows an unlimited number of free private repositories
- Can integrate many APIs and third-party services
- Has very reliable uptime

#### GitLab Disadvantages

Of course, like any other tool available today, GitLab comes with its own share of disadvantages such as:

- The UI can be a bit complicated for reviewing
- The tool itself has a few bugs which can make it a bit sloppy

Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system that allows developers to handle everything from small to very large projects with top speed and efficiency. Its goals include data integrity, speed, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows, which essentially means multiple people can work together on the same code without hindering the other’s progress.

#### Basic sections in the artile

I'm skipping the following sections because they are basic:

1. Sign Into Your Account
2. Create Your First GitLab
3. Open a Git Bash and Configure a GitProject
4. Create a Project Folder or Directory to Initialize Git
5. Create an Example Text File
6. Add the File to Staging and Commit the Changes
7. Push Local Changes to the Remote Repository

#### Common Problems When Using GitLab

Saying Git is complex is an understatement. So when you’re brand-new to the world of Git, you are bound to make mistakes. In this section, we’ll cover the six common Git mistakes, as well as solutions to help you fix them.

_Problem #1: Spelled that Last Commit Message Wrong_:

When working on a code for a considerable amount of time, you start making spelling mistakes. If you spell your last comment message wrong, all you need to do is enter the following command:

- Solution: `git commit –amend`
- That will open up the editor, allowing you to make the required changes to your last commit message.

_Problem #2: Add a File to Your Last Commit_:

You missed a file, forgot to save it, or perhaps have to make a minor change to the last commit. After adding that missed file, run the command. It should look something like this:

```bash
git add missed-file.txt
git commit –amend
```

At this stage, you can either amend the commit message or save it to retain the message.

_Problem #3: Committing the Changes to the Master Branch_:

Imagine you’re working on a new feature, but you forget to open a new branch for it. In your haste, you ended up already committing a lot of files that are now sitting on the master branch.

GitLab can stop you from pushing directly to the master branch. In this case, however, you can roll back all the changes to a new branch by entering the following three commands:

```bash
git branch future-brunch
git reset HEAD~ –hard
git checkout future-brunch
```

Applying the above command will create a new branch, roll back the master branch to where it was before you committed the changes, and then provide you a new branch with all your previous changes.

**Note**: Be sure to commit or stash all your changes first. Otherwise, you will lose all your progress.

_Problem #4: Misspelling Your Branch Name_:

You can rename your branch in the same way you rename a file with the `mv` command, which involves moving the branch to a new location with the correct name. Like this:

`git branch -m future-brunch feature-branch`

If you already pushed the branch, you’ll have to carry out a few extra steps. First, you will have to delete the old branch from the remote and then push up a new one.

```bash
git push origin –delete future-brunch
git push origin feature-branch
```

_Problem #5: Removing the File You Mistakenly Added to Your Repository_:

Regardless of whether you add a rogue ENV file, a personal picture, or a build directory, it’s all fixable.

If you simply staged the file and didn’t commit yet, you can reset that staged file by using the following command:

`git reset /assets/img/misty-and-pepper.jpg`

On the other hand, if you have already committed that change, you’ll have to run an extra step before. It’ll go like this:

```bash
git reset –soft HEAD~1
git reset /assets/img/misty-and-pepper.jpg
rm /assets/img/misty-and-pepper.jpg
git commit
```

Applying the above command will undo the commit, remove the image, and then add a new commit in its place.
