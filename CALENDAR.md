[Getting started with Calendly](https://calendly.com/blog/getting-started-guide)

- **Start sharing your links**: When you create a Calendly account, you'll see three ready-to-share event types: a 15-minute meeting, a 30-minute meeting, and a 60-minute meeting. Everything is customizable, including name and description, your availability, and the event’s duration

- You won’t be able to leverage follow-ups or customize your notifications. However, you and your clients will still receive automatic event notifications so you don’t have to deal with rescheduling and cancellation manually.

[What Is Calendly and How Do You Get Started?](https://www.dignited.com/98161/what-is-calendly-and-how-do-you-get-started/)

- You connect the Google Calendar so that they are in sync and do not conflict with your existing schedules
- Calendly has 4 major tabs:
  - Event types: This shows you the current events you have created and those available to you depending on the version you are using
  - Scheduled Events: you will see all the scheduled events connected with your account
  - Workflows: Automate all the work you do around events, such as text messages when events are booked, email reminders before events, and more. You can start with a commonly used workflow or create your own

### Creating An Event

- Define the type of event you want people to schedule with you. This includes the duration, location, and availability. In the freemium version that I am using, you are only able to have 15 minutes only. If you wish to have more time, you must upgrade.
- By default, someone can connect with you in an anonymous 15 min event. You can also create a new event with details
  - Click “New Event Type” under the “Event Types” tab
  - Choose from these two basic options that are available
  - Give it a title
  - Select the location - different options
  - Enter the rest of the details > Next
  - customize hours
  - You can leave the rest at default and select “Next” to finalize

Your Basic free subscription allows 1 event type.
