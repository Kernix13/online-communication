# Free Text Voice and Video Chat Tools

1. Discord: chat, collaboration
1. Slack: chat, collaboration
1. Zoom: the best option for video conferencing and screensharing, chat
1. Google hangouts / chat: text, voice, video communication

Zoom is mainly used as a video confering tool. I assume Google hangouts are okay but I personally have no experience in using that tool.

Discord tends to be used on a personal basis whereas Slack is more commonly used by companies by their employees and clients, but both are nearly identical in form and function.

## Discord

You can download a desktop version, or use the [online website option](https://discord.com/login). Note a **server** is the term for your Discord account where you can invite people to join.

Nearly all Markdown that you can use on GitHub is available in Discord and Slack. Check out my [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/Kernix13/markdown-cheatsheet) repo for a comprehensive list of everything you can use in your `*.md` files.

### Setting up a Server

Here are the basic steps:

1. Create your account and configure your settings
1. Click the green + button to start create your server. That opens up the server creation menu.
1. Answer questions about the subject of your server to pick a template
1. Choose a name for your server then click "Create"
1. Invite people to join your server: you’ll see the option to either invite your friends directly or share an invite link

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

### Channels

Channels are like forum topics. Every channel has a name associated with it and holds its own chat history. By default, when you make a new channel, everyone will be able to see and post in it.

- To make a new channel, head into your server’s drop-down menu on the top-left and select “Create Channel”
- Type a name for the channel and from there, a menu pops up letting you customize your channel
- You can also delete channels when you don’t need them anymore, but once a channel is deleted, everything within it is gone for good
- You can right-click on any channel to edit the channel. Here, you can write a brief description for each channel, outlining what its for, any rules you might want to have inside, etc.
- You can also right-click a blank space in the channel sidebar to find an option to add categories. Channels can be grouped by category for example DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, etc. In the DESIGN category you could have channels called Web DEsign, Graphic Design, Figma, Illustrator, etc.
- You can rearrange and customize the look of your channels list by dragging and dropping individual channels

### Text channels vs Voice channels

- Text channels behave similarly to how you may send messages on other platforms
- Voice channels are part of what makes Discord special
- Click on a voice channel and you’re placed in a room to talk with your device’s microphone. Unlike Direct Messages, users in a server won’t be startled by a ringtone when you join the voice channel
- Voice channels also allow you to use your device’s camera to see your friends for a video chat. You can also share your device’s screen
- You can have an unlimited amount of people in a voice call at once, and up to 25 people video chatting at the same time

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

### Roles and Moderators

Well-run Discord servers often have different tiers of leadership roles, each with different permissions on the board. You may want to give a few serious users the ability to create new boards or edit channels, or let your most active users become moderators to enforce the rules.

1. Locate the server name in the top right-hand corner of the screen and click the caret to the right
1. Click “Server Settings”
1. In the right-hand sidebar, click “Roles”
1. Find and click the “Create Role” button
1. Here, you’ll be asked to name the new role and decide how the new role title will be displayed when you assign it to users.
1. Navigate to the “Permissions” tab where you can choose exactly how much power users with this role have on your server. There are a lot of different options — make sure you know exactly how much authority you want to give someone on your server before doling out permissions
1. Navigate to the “Manage Users” to easily search the server’s userbase and assign the role to whomever you see fit
1. You’ll never have to alter your own permissions — you have access to everything.
1. In this settings menu, you can also edit the default settings for everyone on the server.
1. Find the @everyone role in the list of roles and you’ll be able to edit those permissions
1. You can build roles for really active users or helpful community members to give them a treat for contributing to the server. These don’t need to come with special responsibilities

### Adding Bots

A small team of bots is a must-have on any busy Discord server. Bots can automate a lot of regular tasks on a server, like reminding users of rules.

- There are a slew of helpful bots available online for free and adding them to your server is easy. Check out [Bots on Discord](https://bots.ondiscord.xyz/) and [TopGG](https://top.gg/)
- Once you find a reputable bot you’d like to add to your server, there will be a clear option to “Add” or “Invite” the bot to your server
- This should open up a pop-up window or new tab that explains exactly what permissions you’re giving the bot and asking which server you’d like to add the bot to. Pick your server from the drop-down list and click “Continue”
- You’ll be asked to confirm the permissions you’re giving the bot. Definitely read this list. If you’re only adding popular bots, there won’t be any trouble
- All Discord bots operate differently. Some will live only on your server, while others give you access to completely separate dashboards. Most Discord bots come with instructions and are designed to be easy to use. It takes some experimentation to figure out what bots will work best for your server

## Slack

Slack is a channel-based messaging platform; a workplace messaging tool through which you can send messages and files. This means that Slack is an instant messaging tool. These add ons are not important for using Slack as the main feature is all about communicating with colleagues.

There are two types of chat in Slack: direct message or DM (person-to-person chat), and channels (group chat). Although they can involve up to eight persons, DMs are always private

When customers/clients want to use Slack, they select a name for their Slack instance. This becomes a part of their unique URL. Slack channels can be public or private, with the former allowing anyone to see and join, and the latter allowing only members of the channel to see it or ask others to join.

All of the real communication takes place in the chat window. You can read any message reply, utilize emoji reactions, upload gifs, see RSS feeds, create reminders, receive add-on notifications, and use a variety of other features like whistles and bells.

You can share files and other documents with your teammates, such as images, word/text documents, and videos.

You can also mention the name of your teammates, which send them notifications on their computer or mobile phone. This way, you can get their attention. You can also mention a group's name, making it work as a walkie talkie.
You can start a voice or video conference call with your teammates who are on the Slack team.

You can also set reminders for yourself and others: built-in reminders, Google Calendar, and various to-do lists which you can use so that the volunteers can track the upcoming events and deadlines.

### Setting up a Workspace

In your workspace, you create channels, which are like chat rooms or group chats. When you use Slack, you will be starting with a main workspace and then creating a variety of subspaces (known as channels) for your conversations.

- Slack will ask you to verify your email with a code. Go to your email account, retrieve the code, return to the Slack registration page, and enter it.
- Click on “Create a Workspace.” Slack will ask you for the name of your company or team; what it’s really asking for is a name for your workspace. Type in a name and click “Next.”
- Slack will ask you to type in a name for a project you’re working on but you can skip this I believe. Click “Next.”
- On the next screen, you can enter the names and email addresses of people you’d like to add to your Slack workspace, and Slack will send them invitations. You can also use a shareable invite link. If you’re not ready to invite anyone yet, you can skip this page
- Your Slack channel has been set up at this point. Select See Your Channel in Slack to start using it
- To send messages, select `New Message`, add a name or group of names, type your message, and select `Send Now`

Here are notes from the Slack website:

- Sign-up with Slack and click the confirmation email then click Create a Workspace and follow the prompts
- Invite members to your workspace - send an invitation - click your workspace name in the top left
- Select Invite people to [workspace name] from the menu
- Enter the email address for anyone you'd like to invite and click Send
- Fill out your profile: click the default profile picture in the top right - Click Profile from the menu, then click Edit profile

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

### Slack Left Sidebar

- <ins>Settings</ins>: To enter a settings menu, click your username or the drop-down arrow next to the Slack team name. You can alter your options (sidebar themes, messages, emoji style, and more)
- <ins>Notifications</ins>: To change your notification preferences, click the bell icon in the top-right corner of the sidebar. You may establish a Do Not Disturb schedule, snooze them, and more. Almost every form of notification is enabled when you sign in to Slack for the first time. However, the service provides a variety of options for managing them
- <ins>Starred</ins>: Stars are a way to prioritize an item in Slack. To move channels or direct messages to the top of your left sidebar, star them. In Slack, you can also star messages to simply return to them later
- <ins>Create Channels</ins>: To make a new channel, go to the sidebar and click the Add button next to Channels. After that, you'll be given the option of creating a public or private channel. You'll also be able to give the channel a name, invite people to join, and briefly describe the channel's purpose
- <ins>Channels</ins>: Chat rooms are referred to as channels. You can name chat rooms whatever you want
- <ins>Direct Messages</ins>: In the sidebar, below Channels, you'll find a Direct Messages area, followed by the names of everyone invited to your Slack team. To send a private, one-to-one message to anyone, click on their name. A window will open if you click the Plus button adjacent to the Direct Messages section, allowing you to find or start a direct message conversation

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

### Slack Top Menubar

- <ins>Chat Room Name</ins>: The name of the room you're in, whether a channel or a direct message window, always appears on the left side of the menubar. A drop-down menu appears next to the name, allowing you to access items like message archives, channel notification purposes, and advanced parameters
- <ins>Search</ins>: Slack's search capability is one of its most important features; both messages and files may be searched. Slack will propose search modifiers to help you narrow your results when you click the search box, and when you type in a search word, Slack will show you relevant channels, team members, and search history
- <ins>Mentions and Reactions</ins>: You can type a person's `@username` to notify them while having a conversation in a channel. The Mentions & Reactions `@` sign in the top right corner of Slack allows you to see your most recent @mentions, @channel messages, and any highlight words
- <ins>Starred Items</ins>: Messages, files, snippets, posts, and comments can all be given a star to make them simpler to find. When you star a channel, it displays in the sidebar, but to access other starred items, you must click the Starred sign in the top-right corner of Slack

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

### Slack Chat Rooms

- <ins>Set Reminders</ins>: if you need to remind yourself that you have 30 minutes to write a piece, enter "/remind me in 30 minutes to publish", and Slack will discreetly remind you

### Create channels

- Select the + located to the right of the main Channels heading
- Select Create a channel in the drop down menu
- Enter a name and description for your channel, then select Create
- Select the Make private slider if you want to control who can join the channel. With this option off, anyone can read and add themselves to the channel

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

### Send Direct Messages in Slack

Every message that isn't sent within a channel is considered a direct message. You can send messages to anyone on your team

- Select the name of the person you want to send a direct message
- Type your message into the text field, then press Enter
- To send a document, select the paperclip icon, then select a file from your computer
- Enter a description for your file, then select Upload

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

### Send a Group Direct Message

Group direct messages are a lot like direct messages, but they allow you to talk to a specific set of people without creating a special channel. It's faster and neater than making a channel

- Select the `+` next to the Direct messages section heading
- Select the people you want to add to the group direct message, then select Go
- The group direct message functions exactly like your one-on-one direct messages. You can return to this group direct message at any time by selecting it in the menu
- If you ever want to delete this group direct message, right-click it in the menu, then select Close conversation

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

### How to place calls

Slack allows you to call your team members individually or in a group, and you have the option to use voice or video chat

- To call a single team member, open your direct message with that team member, then select the Call icon
- The call will open in another window and connect as soon as the other person answers
- Use the icons at the bottom of the call to mute your mic, toggle your video on and off, share your screen, send emoji reactions, and hang up, from left to right. The gear icon in the upper left provides an Options menu, and the silhouette with the `+` icon allows you to add people to the call

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

### Hide Channels and Direct Messages

As your workspace grows, you may find that it ends up cluttered with a lot of channels and conversations that aren't always used. Alternately, you may find that you have a difficult time figuring out which channels still have unread messages. In both of these situations, your best option is to hide channels and direct messages that don't have any new messages

- Select your workspace name in the upper left corner of the page
- Select Preferences > Sidebar
- Select the radial next to unread conversations only, or unread conversations plus your starred section
- If you prefer to mute just a single channel or conversation at a time, just right-click that channel, then select mute channel
