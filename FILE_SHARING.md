## Google docs

Google Docs is partially covered in the Google Drive section in the Cloud Storage file, bt here I go into more detail. And of course, they have more than just docs.

The first link below has some good content, but I barely have notes for the other 2 links since it is basic "How-To" content.

<h3 id="how-to-use-google-docs" align="center"><a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/how-to-use-google-docs-tutorial-tips-tricks-3110289/"><strong>How to use Google Docs</strong></a>
</h3>

Google Docs is a cloud-based word processor that is part of Google’s G Suite. Alongside the rest of Google’s cloud-based services, like Google Drive, Sheets, Slides, and of course, Gmail, Google Workspace offers a comprehensive productivity platform for businesses and students alike.

Google Docs enables you to compose and format a wide variety of documents, and it integrates with Sheets in a way that allows you quickly add a graph or table from a Google Sheets spreadsheet. It also supports templates and add-ons to make it even more versatile for niche tasks.

- Instead of saving documents on your hard drive, the files live in Google Drive
- This offers a number of advantages over traditional word processors such as collaborative editing in real-time and automatic backups.
- It’s also fully cross-platform, so you can access it from any browser or mobile device
- It has the same toolbar across the top of the screen and the same keyboard shortcuts as MS Word and other similar document writers
- You access your document in a browser rather than a standalone application

The next 2 sections are on the basics:

- How to create a new document
- How to delete a document

#### Advanced tips and tricks

**Using Google Docs offline**: Skip

**How to check word count in Google Docs**

- To check your current word count, open the document you want to check.
- Click Tools in the top toolbar, then Word count.
- Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Shift + C.
- The pop-up window will display the current page count, word count, character count, and character count without spaces.
- Beneath that, you’ll also find a toggle for Display word count while typing.
- This will leave a small box in the corner with a constantly updating word count

**How to change margins in Google Docs**

There are two ways to change margins in Google Docs: document-wide settings and specific sections

- Open your document, click File in the top left, then Page setup from the dropdown menu.
- From here you can change the margins in the pop-up window, and set them as default if you want all future documents to use these settings

Knowing how to change margins in Google Docs for a specific section is a bit more complicated, but still similar to what you’re probably used to from other word processors

- select the section of text to adjust,
- then click and drag the blue triangles at the top of the screen.
- The numbers displayed are the difference between the current setting and the default margin, rather than the distance from the edge of the page

**How to share and collaborate in Google Docs**

One of Google Docs’ greatest strengths is sharing and collaboration. Sharing documents with people is as easy as creating a link. Those with editing access can also edit the document at the same time. All changes are visible in real-time.

- To share a document, you first need to click the large blue Share button in the top right.
- The box that pops up offers two separate ways to share your document.
- The first is entering the email addresses of everyone you want to share with.
- If the `Notify people` box is ticked, an email will be sent to all parties notifying them of the change, and the document will appear in their shared Drive folders.
- The default settings allow anyone you share the document with to edit it, but you can adjust this by changing the dropdown on the right-hand side.
- You can also enter a custom message for the email in the text box at the bottom.
- the default settings also allow anyone with editing permissions to share and change permissions, which you may not want when sharing with people you don’t entirely trust.
- To change this, click the Settings cog in the top right and uncheck the box for Editors can change permissions and share
- The second way to share a document is via a hyperlink that you can send to anyone on the web.
- Note, however, that the default Restricted setting will still limit accessibility to just the email addresses you’ve already shared the document with.
- By changing the setting to Anyone with the link, anyone, including those who don’t even have a Google account, can open the document.
- You can also adjust the permissions on the right to allow people with the link to not just view the document but also comment on or even edit it.

**Using strikethrough and subscript in Google Docs**

Strikethrough, subscript, superscript, and other special formatting settings are easy to access in Google Docs, although some are hidden away in the menu. The main ribbon only has buttons for bold, italic, and underline formatting. The rest can be found by opening the Format tab at the top of the screen, then expanding Text. Here you can see all six formatting options, as well as the keyboard shortcuts for each.

- Bold: `Ctrl + B`
- Italic: `Ctrl + I`
- Underline: `Ctrl + U`
- Strikethrough: `Alt + Shift + 5`
- Subscript: `Ctrl + ,`
- Superscript: `Ctrl + .`

Google Docs can be described as a no-cost web-based word processor provided by Google in conjunction with its entire Office suite, Google Drive. It is designed to compete with Microsoft Office. Other cloud-based services included in the suite are Sheets (Excel) with Slides (Powerpoint).

Google Docs is available on every device and platform. It requires Internet access and a browser for the web. Docs supports a variety of formats of files, including .doc, .docx .txt, .rtf and .odt It makes it easy to convert and view Microsoft Office files directly from Google Drive.
