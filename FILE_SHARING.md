## Google docs

Google Docs is partially covered in the Google Drive section in the Cloud Storage file, bt here I go into more detail. And of course, they have more than just docs.

The first link below has some good content, but I barely have notes for the other 2 links since it is basic "How-To" content.

<h3 id="how-to-use-google-docs" align="center"><a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/how-to-use-google-docs-tutorial-tips-tricks-3110289/"><strong>How to use Google Docs</strong></a>
</h3>

Google Docs is a cloud-based word processor that is part of Google’s G Suite. Alongside the rest of Google’s cloud-based services, like Google Drive, Sheets, Slides, and of course, Gmail, Google Workspace offers a comprehensive productivity platform for businesses and students alike.

Google Docs enables you to compose and format a wide variety of documents, and it integrates with Sheets in a way that allows you quickly add a graph or table from a Google Sheets spreadsheet. It also supports templates and add-ons to make it even more versatile for niche tasks.

- Instead of saving documents on your hard drive, the files live in Google Drive
- This offers a number of advantages over traditional word processors such as collaborative editing in real-time and automatic backups.
- It’s also fully cross-platform, so you can access it from any browser or mobile device
- It has the same toolbar across the top of the screen and the same keyboard shortcuts as MS Word and other similar document writers
- You access your document in a browser rather than a standalone application

The next 2 sections are on the basics:

- How to create a new document
- How to delete a document

#### Advanced tips and tricks

**Using Google Docs offline**: Skip

**How to check word count in Google Docs**

- To check your current word count, open the document you want to check.
- Click Tools in the top toolbar, then Word count.
- Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Shift + C.
- The pop-up window will display the current page count, word count, character count, and character count without spaces.
- Beneath that, you’ll also find a toggle for Display word count while typing.
- This will leave a small box in the corner with a constantly updating word count

**How to change margins in Google Docs**

There are two ways to change margins in Google Docs: document-wide settings and specific sections

- Open your document, click File in the top left, then Page setup from the dropdown menu.
- From here you can change the margins in the pop-up window, and set them as default if you want all future documents to use these settings

Knowing how to change margins in Google Docs for a specific section is a bit more complicated, but still similar to what you’re probably used to from other word processors

- select the section of text to adjust,
- then click and drag the blue triangles at the top of the screen.
- The numbers displayed are the difference between the current setting and the default margin, rather than the distance from the edge of the page

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

**How to share and collaborate in Google Docs**

One of Google Docs’ greatest strengths is sharing and collaboration. Sharing documents with people is as easy as creating a link. Those with editing access can also edit the document at the same time. All changes are visible in real-time.

- To share a document, you first need to click the large blue Share button in the top right.
- The box that pops up offers two separate ways to share your document.
- The first is entering the email addresses of everyone you want to share with.
- If the `Notify people` box is ticked, an email will be sent to all parties notifying them of the change, and the document will appear in their shared Drive folders.
- The default settings allow anyone you share the document with to edit it, but you can adjust this by changing the dropdown on the right-hand side.
- You can also enter a custom message for the email in the text box at the bottom.
- the default settings also allow anyone with editing permissions to share and change permissions, which you may not want when sharing with people you don’t entirely trust.
- To change this, click the Settings cog in the top right and uncheck the box for Editors can change permissions and share
- The second way to share a document is via a hyperlink that you can send to anyone on the web.
- Note, however, that the default Restricted setting will still limit accessibility to just the email addresses you’ve already shared the document with.
- By changing the setting to Anyone with the link, anyone, including those who don’t even have a Google account, can open the document.
- You can also adjust the permissions on the right to allow people with the link to not just view the document but also comment on or even edit it.

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

**Using strikethrough and subscript in Google Docs**

Strikethrough, subscript, superscript, and other special formatting settings are easy to access in Google Docs, although some are hidden away in the menu. The main ribbon only has buttons for bold, italic, and underline formatting. The rest can be found by opening the Format tab at the top of the screen, then expanding Text. Here you can see all six formatting options, as well as the keyboard shortcuts for each.

- Bold: `Ctrl + B`
- Italic: `Ctrl + I`
- Underline: `Ctrl + U`
- Strikethrough: `Alt + Shift + 5`
- Subscript: `Ctrl + ,`
- Superscript: `Ctrl + .`

Google Docs can be described as a no-cost web-based word processor provided by Google in conjunction with its entire Office suite, Google Drive. It is designed to compete with Microsoft Office. Other cloud-based services included in the suite are Sheets (Excel) with Slides (Powerpoint).

Google Docs is available on every device and platform. It requires Internet access and a browser for the web. Docs supports a variety of formats of files, including .doc, .docx .txt, .rtf and .odt It makes it easy to convert and view Microsoft Office files directly from Google Drive.

## Confluence

<h3 id="confluence-basics" align="center"><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/guides/get-started/confluence-overview#about-confluence"><strong>Confluence basics</strong></a>
</h3>

Create, collaborate, and organize all your work in one place:

- Dynamic pages give your team a place to create, capture, and collaborate on any project or idea.
- Spaces help your team structure, organize, and share work, so every team member has visibility into institutional knowledge and access to the information they need to do their best work

Confluence is for teams of any size and type, from those with mission-critical, high-stakes projects that need rigor behind their practices, to those that are looking for a space to build team culture and engage with one another in a more open and authentic way.

**Hosting options**: 1. Cloud, 2. Data Center, 3. Server

#### Key Terms

- Page: Your content lives in pages – living documents you create on your Confluence site.
  - You can create pages for almost anything, from project plans to meeting notes, troubleshooting guides, policies, and more.
  - Confluence comes bundled with templates to help you make beautiful pages for almost any kind of content.
  - If you can’t find a template for the type of content you want to create, you can always start with a blank page
- Space: Pages are stored in spaces – workspaces where you can collaborate on work and keep all your content organized.
  - It’s best to group related content together in the same space, but you can create as many or as few spaces as your team needs.
  - For example, one marketing team might keep all of its work in one space, with a page for each campaign, while another might set up a separate space for every single campaign.
  - Each space comes with an overview (or homepage) and a blog, so it’s easy to share updates and announcements with your whole team
- Page Tree: Organize space content with a hierarchical page tree that makes finding work quick and easy.
  - Nest pages under related spaces and pages to organize pages in just about any way.

<h3 id="how-to-use-confluence-for-documentation" align="center"><a href="https://www.adaptavist.com/blog/how-to-use-confluence-for-documentation"><strong>How to use Confluence for documentation</strong></a>
</h3>

Confluence is an incredibly versatile tool with a number of different applications:

- It can be used as a company wiki, department hub or co-working space to facilitate remote work - a peer-to-peer collaboration within organisations
- And also to create technical documentation for external users of your products, plus more

#### What is documentation and why is it important

Documentation should display and describe what a product is, how it works and how to use it properly. It should be constantly updated to reflect technological and software updates, and good documentation will not only be correct, consistent and complete, but also navigable and user-friendly.

Technical documentation plays an important role in the overall customer experience and can influence purchase decisions, renewal rates and customer satisfaction.

#### Why use Confluence for documentation

- Confluence is extremely collaborative
- This allows technical writers, software developers and marketers to work in harmony for quicker, more accurate documentation creation
- Its intuitive interface and powerful editor makes it easy to create content, pages and spaces

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

#### Using Confluence for documentation

**Step 1: Create the framework**

- Simply create a new space (Spaces>Create space) and select Documentation space
- then name your space, add a description and set permissions

**Step 2: Implement Confluence permissions to make content more (and less) accessible**

- When pages are in draft state, half-finished or littered with comments, it’s best practice to keep them hidden
- you should restrict permissions as soon as you create a new page.
- This might mean keeping draft content exclusive to select team members or restricting a public page to staff members until it’s ready to be accessible to the public.
- When you share pages with reviewers for their feedback, make sure you change their restrictions accordingly
- Hint: In-line and page comments can be extremely useful during the documentation drafting process. Just make sure to delete any comments before publishing your page

**Step 3: Make content more visually appealing**

- good documentation should feature plenty of images to help illustrate exactly what you’re telling users to do.
- Use up-to-date screenshots, gifs and video walk-throughs of your product in use, ideally with text to annotate the key features and steps
- As well as illustrating your product in action, you should keep your documentation visually appealing and eye-catching.
- This means using subheadings, bold text and colour appropriately

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

**Step 4: Focus on your organisation: Make your content clear and pages easily navigable**

- Part of making your pages pretty is keeping them clear of clutter and breaking up chunks of text into easily digestible sections
- have a structured page hierarchy and make sure there’s a clear pathway through your documentation.
- That means avoiding orphaned pages and making sure there are prominent links between relevant sections

**Step 5: Make your Confluence pages more interactive and seek out user feedback**

- Any UX designer knows that a good website is one that users want to interact and engage with, and your documentation should be no different.
- As well as using buttons, tabs and links to encourage users to click through and explore, add more dedicated features to speak directly to your users and encourage them to share information with you

**Step 6: Get your Confluence documentation online**

- You’ll need to use an add-on like Scroll Viewport to publish directly to the web, adding a customised web layer on top of the Confluence documentation.
- This means end users can view your Confluence documentation as a stylised website, without compromising your internal Confluence user interface

This is a HUGE documentation page! So huge that I am not going to cover it other than posting their table of contents and highlighting some important sections:

- Why do we need Confluence?
- Advantages
- Getting Familiar with Terminology
  - Dashboard
  - Concept of Spaces
  - Space Sidebar
  - Header menu
  - Create functionality
- How to create and manage your own space and pages
  - Step #1: Creating your space
  - Step #2: Creating new pages
  - Step #3: Formatting options
- Sample Document
- Some FAQ’s

#### Advantages

- #1. **Content management**: Content management includes the creation, maintenance, organization, and deletion of content. The content creation tools are easy to use and include a variety of functions- from basic text formatting, creating tables all the way to linking documents and embedding macros. The content can be organized into separate spaces, sorted and arranged in hierarchical order as required.
- #2. **Search**: This tool supports a full-text search for all the content. The search results will include any matching results for the text in the pages main content and comments. This results in a very detailed search.
- #3. **Confluence Templates**: This tool comes with some best practices templates that can be used to create pre-formatted pages.
- #4. **Integration with JIRA**: JIRA and Confluence are both developed by Atlassian and have seamless integration with each other. The development work can be tracked in JIRA and the corresponding reports can be generated by automatic linking.
- #5. **Page and File versioning**: As this is a collaboration tool, needless to say, it would be used by various cross-functional teams at all levels multiple times. To keep track of the changes made since the last edit, Confluence saves the older version of pages and files automatically. This older version can be used to compare the difference or even revert the last edit if required.
- #6. **Feedback**: Team feedback in form of comments can be put on the pages and always referred to or even searched for when required.
- #7. **User Management**: User and group-based permissions can be set up. It is even possible to set up separate viewing, editing and admin permissions for each space. We will discuss the concept of spaces in the next section.
- #8. **Add-ons and plugins**: This tool has a wide range of available add-on plugins that can be used to perform function above and beyond what standard the tool has to offer. Some popular add-ons are Draw.io Diagrams, Balsamiq Mockups, Scroll PDF exporter, etc.

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

#### Terminology: Dashboard

- The dashboard is the landing page that a logged in user first sees
- The dashboard gives a quick snapshot of the recent updates by the team along with the recent updates done by the user
- Along with the updates, the dashboard also shows the Spaces that the user is a member of
- The sidebar containing updates and space details is collapsible to optimize the viewing experience
- The dashboard is customizable and the admin can set up a universal dashboard that all users will see

#### Terminology: Concept of Spaces

- Spaces in this tool are a way to organize the content.
- Spaces can be thought of as individual file containers where the content can be categorized and organized in a meaningful way
- There is no standard rule of how many spaces need to be or should be created.
- The user can create any number of spaces with their own specific purposes to facilitate collaboration within teams
- Space directory contains a list of all spaces that are created by confluence.
- You can browse the spaces based on the space type – site, personal or my spaces.
- My spaces refer to the sites created by the logged in user himself and can be either site or personal space
- Confluence permits the creation of two spaces- site spaces and personal spaces:

| Characteristic       | Site Spaces          | Personal space                |
| :------------------- | :------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| Purpose              | Collaboration        | Personal work space           |
| Accessible by:       | All Confluence users | Creator of space (private)    |
| -                    | -                    | All Confluence users (public) |
| Listed in directory: | Yes                  | No                            |

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

#### Terminology: Space Sidebar

- The space sidebar is a collapsible menu on the space and pages and is used to navigate different pages.
- The pages are shown in the form of a hierarchical tree structure.

#### Terminology: Header menu

- The header menu is visible at all pages and contains the Confluence Logo and a default menu with default options- Spaces, People, Create, help menu, notifications, and personal profile management.
- This header menu is customizable and more menu options can be displayed as required by the user
- This dashboard page is accessible from any page- user can click on the logo on the main menu and user will be redirected to the dashboard.

#### Terminology: Create functionality

- Create functionality is used to create new pages within any chosen spaces in the desired hierarchical order

#### Creating your space

1. choose the kind of space you want to create
1. fill in the required information in the next step. You will be required to enter space name, a space key, and other mandatory or optional field depending on the kind of space you chose. The space key is a unique key used in the space URL and is auto-generated when user types in Space name, but you can change it if required

#### Creating new pages

You have the option to create a blank new page or chose from available templates. The very first page will be created as the Parent page. Subsequent pages can be created under this parent page or as separate page depending on how you want to structure your space

1. Creating page from available templates
1. Depending on the template chosen, you would be required to perform some additional steps like entering the page name, etc
