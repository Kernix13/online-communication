#### What is Google Drive? How does it work?

- Google Drive is Google’s cloud storage solution. It allows you to store your media and documents on Google servers...and access them from just about any device with an internet connection
- You can access Drive on the web by heading to drive.google.com
- Regarding storage, you get 15GB for free, shared between Drive, Gmail, and Photos

#### Types of supported files

- Storage space is the primary concern for most cloud storage solutions, but file type limitations may also be significant for many users

From [Files you can store in Google Drive](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/37603?hl=en):

**Supported file types**

Any file type can be stored in Drive. These are the most common file types you can preview in Google Drive:

<ins>General files</ins>

- Archive files (.ZIP, .RAR, tar, gzip)
- Audio formats (MP3, MPEG, WAV, .ogg, .opus)
- Image files (.JPEG, .PNG, .GIF, .BMP, .TIFF, .SVG)
- Markup/Code (.CSS, .HTML, .PHP, .C, .CPP, .H, .HPP, .JS, .java, .py)
- Text files (.TXT)
- Video files (WebM, .MPEG4, .3GPP, .MOV, .AVI, .MPEGPS, .WMV, .FLV, .ogg)

<ins>Adobe files</ins>

- Autodesk AutoCad (.DXF)
- Illustrator (.AI)
- Photoshop (.PSD)
- Portable Document Format (.PDF)
- PostScript (.EPS, .PS)
- Scalable Vector Graphics (.SVG)
- Tagged Image File Format (.TIFF) - best with RGB .TIFF images
- TrueType (.TTF)

<ins>Microsoft files</ins>

- Excel (.XLS and .XLSX)
- PowerPoint (.PPT and .PPTX)
- Word (.DOC and .DOCX)
- XML Paper Specification (.XPS)
- Password-protected Microsoft Office files

<ins>Apple files</ins>

- Editor files (.key, .numbers)

#### How to upload and download Google Drive files

- The first is the drag and drop method: select a file you want to upload from your PC, drag it to Drive in a browser window, and drop it. This works for both individual files as well as folders. A small window in the bottom right will show the upload progress
- The second option is to click on the New button in the website’s top-left corner and select File upload or Folder upload. Then choose the files or folders you want to upload, click Open or Upload
- You can also download files from the web client by right-clicking and selecting Download. This works for both individual files and entire folders

#### How to organize and delete files on Google Drive

- You can leave them all in one place (My Drive by default) or put them in different folders and subfolders
- To move files into a folder on the web, use the drag and drop method for the web client and the Drive folder

**Creating a new folder**

- To create a folder in the web client, click the New button and select New folder.
- You can also right-click in the Drive folder on your computer and create a new folder like you normally would on Windows. On mobile, tap the blue + button and select Folder.

**How to delete Drive files**

- The easiest option on the web is to select a file or folder and press the Delete key on your keyboard. Lastly, click on Move to Trash

#### How to share files on Google Drive

- To share a Google Drive file or folder, right-click on it and click the Get link option, modify the settings, then click on Copy link and share the link with the people you want
- Note that you have some control over what people can do with your link. The default Restricted mode means only people you explicitly add can see the file. You can change this so that anyone with the link can view, comment, or edit

#### How to use Google Drive with third-party apps

Drive is connected with Google’s office productivity suite (Google Workspace), including Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides, rivaling Microsoft’s Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.

Although these three services have their dedicated websites, every document you create is automatically saved in Drive. Drive also supports other Google services like Google Forms, Google Drawings, etc.

- Click the blue New button in the top-left corner of the website and select Google Docs, Google Sheets, or Google Slides
- You can check out the complete list via the web interface. Click the New button and select More, followed by Connect more apps. When you see something you like, click on it and select the Install button to integrate it with Drive.

#### Using Gmail’s Drive integration

- To share a Drive file in Gmail, start composing a message and click the Drive icon at the bottom of the screen.
- You can then navigate to the file and share it. On mobile, click the Attach icon (the paperclip) at the top of the screen, then Insert from Drive.
- This is also an easy way to share large files shared as links rather than attachments

[How to use Dropbox for team collaboration](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3607759/how-to-use-dropbox-for-team-collaboration.html)

Shared folders in Dropbox give teams a common work area to gather key files, create to-do lists, edit and comment on documents, and more.

Dropbox is best known as a cloud storage service, but it also offers some collaboration tools. For example, you and your co-workers can add comments to files and create shared to-do lists. These functions are available with all Dropbox individual user plans (including both free and paid versions) and team accounts for business.

> It makes no sense to cover dropbox if you can not collaborate and share on the free plan!
