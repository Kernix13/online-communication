#### How to upload and download Google Drive files

- The first is the drag and drop method: select a file you want to upload from your PC, drag it to Drive in a browser window, and drop it. This works for both individual files as well as folders. A small window in the bottom right will show the upload progress
- The second option is to click on the New button in the website’s top-left corner and select File upload or Folder upload. Then choose the files or folders you want to upload, click Open or Upload
- You can also download files from the web client by right-clicking and selecting Download. This works for both individual files and entire folders

#### How to organize and delete files on Google Drive

- You can leave them all in one place (My Drive by default) or put them in different folders and subfolders
- To move files into a folder on the web, use the drag and drop method for the web client and the Drive folder

**Creating a new folder**

- To create a folder in the web client, click the New button and select New folder.
- You can also right-click in the Drive folder on your computer and create a new folder like you normally would on Windows. On mobile, tap the blue + button and select Folder.

**How to delete Drive files**

- The easiest option on the web is to select a file or folder and press the Delete key on your keyboard. Lastly, click on Move to Trash

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

#### How to share files on Google Drive

- To share a Google Drive file or folder, right-click on it and click the Get link option, modify the settings, then click on Copy link and share the link with the people you want
- Note that you have some control over what people can do with your link. The default Restricted mode means only people you explicitly add can see the file. You can change this so that anyone with the link can view, comment, or edit

#### How to use Google Drive with third-party apps

Drive is connected with Google’s office productivity suite (Google Workspace), including Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides, rivaling Microsoft’s Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.

Although these three services have their dedicated websites, every document you create is automatically saved in Drive. Drive also supports other Google services like Google Forms, Google Drawings, etc.

- Click the blue New button in the top-left corner of the website and select Google Docs, Google Sheets, or Google Slides
- You can check out the complete list via the web interface. Click the New button and select More, followed by Connect more apps. When you see something you like, click on it and select the Install button to integrate it with Drive.

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

#### Using Gmail’s Drive integration

- To share a Drive file in Gmail, start composing a message and click the Drive icon at the bottom of the screen.
- You can then navigate to the file and share it. On mobile, click the Attach icon (the paperclip) at the top of the screen, then Insert from Drive.
- This is also an easy way to share large files shared as links rather than attachments

</h3>

> Really good article!

- Drive is the most popular cloud service in the world
- When your files are in the cloud, you can access them from wherever you are with any device with an internet connection.
- Plus, you can share them with other people
- Google has often come under fire for its suspicious privacy policies, and Drive is no exception to the controversy.
- Google gives itself permission to scan any Drive file it wants.
- Plus, there’s no zero-knowledge encryption, which means Google holds all encryption keys to your files and can view them whenever it wants to.
- Thankfully, there are ways to encrypt your data, if you’re particularly concerned about privacy.
- Encrypting your files using an encryption service, such as Boxcryptor, before you upload them to the cloud ensures that no one can scan or view them without your permission

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

#### How Does Google Drive Work

Google Drive’s main purpose is to store files and sync them to your computer. You can use Drive’s website to upload files and edit them online.

- Drive recently expanded its syncing capabilities by adding the option to sync any folder on your computer to the Google Drive servers
- Drive works with Google’s entire ecosystem of apps, including its Google Workspace of office apps.
- This means you can use it to create Google Docs files, Google Forms surveys, Google Sheets spreadsheets or Google Slides presentations
- It is also one of the best cloud services for sharing, thanks to its highly customizable sharing options.
- When you share files on Google Drive, you can set permissions for each person you’re sharing with.
- You can even let other users edit Google Docs files with you, allowing you to collaborate with up to 100 people on any Google Workspace document

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

#### How to Use Google Drive

- To use Google Drive, you must first create a Google account
- There are several ways to access Drive. Your first encounter will probably be through the Google Drive website
- To access Drive in your browser, go to `drive.google.com` and log in with the account you just created
- The left side of the screen is home to a navigation bar where you can access Drive’s various tabs. These tabs organize your files by various categories
- The “my Drive” tab houses all of your cloud files
- Meanwhile, “shared with me” keeps all the files that other people have shared with you. These are your main tabs, and you’ll spend most of your time there
- These tabs have their own folder structure, so you can create subfolders to organize your files better
- There are other tabs, as well.
  - You can find recently accessed files in the “recent” tab.
  - “Starred” is where you can find any files you’ve favorited for quick access
- The central area of the browser interface is where you can see all your files and folders.
- You can drag and drop items to move them around, and you can right-click an item to open its menu of options.
- “My Drive” has an extra area at the top, called “quick access,” for your frequently used files
- At the top of the screen, there is a search bar that lets you look for files by name.
- When you click on a Drive file or folder, several icons appear in the area below the search bar.
- These icons let you do things like sharing, renaming, deleting or moving the item you’ve selected.
- These same options (and more) can be found in the right-click menu
- The right-hand side of the screen has a special toolbar with shortcuts to either Google’s own apps or third-party apps that work with Google

Now comes the most important part: how to interact with Drive files. First, you have to upload a file to Drive:

- To upload files, you can click on the “new” button in the top-left corner, then select the file or folder you want to upload.
- An easier method is to simply drag and drop the file into the browser window, which will upload it into the folder you have open in the website interface
- Now that your files are in the cloud, you can right-click on them or use the icons at the top of the screen to interact with them

Probably the most important of these options are the two sharing options:

- The first option is the simpler of the two, and it’s called “get shareable link.”
  - Clicking on it will generate a share link that you can copy and send
- The second sharing option is called “share.”
  - Clicking on it opens up a dialog where you can add people to the file via email address.
  - You can then set various permissions for each person
- Another important option here is the “preview” function.
- You can preview many file types, including images, videos, PDF files, and Microsoft Office and Google Workspace documents.
- Once you’re in the preview window, you can choose “open with” to open the file you’re previewing, either with a Google app — such as Google Sheets or Google Slides — or a third-party app

Moving items around is an easy enough task:

- just click and drag an item to move it into another folder.
- You can also right-click and use the “move to” function.
- If you move an item to the “trash” tab, the item will be deleted.
- You can also do this by clicking on the “remove” option in the right-click menu or the contextual icon at the top

Other options are self-explanatory, such as “download,” “rename,” “make a copy” or “add to starred.”

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

#### Google Drive and Gmail Integration

Gmail uses Drive to store your email attachments, and these count toward your storage limit. Likewise, Drive uses Gmail to share files. Gmail also has an option in the “compose” screen to send Google Drive attachments. It’s near the bottom of the window and is indicated by a dark-gray Drive logo.

#### Using Third-Party Google Drive Apps

- Google Drive has outstanding third-party app support
- Google Workspace Marketplace (formerly the G Suite Marketplace)
- There are many apps in this store, and they can really change the way you work with Drive.
- To connect an app, click on the plus icon in the toolbar on the right side of the screen.
- Then look for the app in the Marketplace and click “install.”
- You can also do this by right-clicking a file, selecting “open with” and clicking “connect more apps.”
- Now you can use apps like Pixlr to edit images, you can create 3D files with SketchUp, organize your workflow with Asana and much more

</h3>

- addressing unwanted collaboration requests and a warning about the risks of sharing folders

#### How to Add Collaborators to a Google Drive Document

Google Drive is great for collaborating with co-workers on a project. It offers fine-tuned control over who can see your files and what they can do with them. With Google Drive, you can add collaborators to either view or edit your documents:

1. Open Google Drive and then open the file you want to share.
1. Select Share (it's located in the upper-right corner of the document).
1. Enter the email addresses of the people you want to add as collaborators.
1. Select the Edit drop-down arrow and choose whether or not collaborators can edit, comment on, or view the document.
1. Click Settings (gear icon) to add sharing restrictions.
1. Check Editors can change permissions and share to allow your collaborators to share the document with others.
1. Check Viewers and commenters can see the option to download, print, and copy to give viewers and commenters these abilities.
1. Select Done to close out.

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

#### How to Share a Folder in Google Drive

Sharing an entire folder with collaborators works similar to sharing a single document. Select the folder you want to share in Google Drive, then open the drop-down menu and select Share, then follow the steps above.

- Once you share a folder, every document or file placed in that folder inherits the same sharing privileges
- NOTE: people sharing editing privileges can move files around

#### How to Address Unwanted Collaboration Requests

- You may also receive collaboration requests from people outside your organization.
- These unsolicited documents could simply be annoying, but they might also represent a possible attempt to gather sensitive documentation.
- You shouldn't open any unknown document or file in Google Drive; instead, you can block the person who sent it by right-clicking the file name from the main Drive page and selecting Block [email address].
- Then, click Block again in the confirmation window

<h3 id="best-practices-for-sharing-in-google-drive" align="center"><a href="https://documentation.its.umich.edu/google-drive-sharing"><strong>Best Practices for Sharing in Google Drive</strong></a>
</h3>

When you share from Google Drive, you can control whether people can edit, comment on, or view your file. It'S recommends using caution when you choose permissions for your files and folders to ensure the privacy and security.

#### Sharing Files in Google Drive

There are two methods to share content within Google Drive:

- People with access: Granting access to specific individuals you want to collaborate with on the file.
- General access: Granting access to anyone who has the link to the file.

We recommend only sharing your files with those who need them.

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

#### People with access

When you share a file with an individual or group, you can choose what they can do with it:

- Viewer: They can view but can’t change or share the file with others.
- Commenter: They can make comments and suggestions but can’t change or share the file with others.
- Editor: They can make changes, accept or reject suggestions, and share the file with others.

TIP: Within shared drives, you can review who you’ve shared a file with outside your shared drive membership. Once shared, you can view these individuals under the Guests tab which appears.

Warning: When granting Editor access to files in My Drive, you automatically allow individuals the opportunity to change the sharing settings of your document and share it with anyone they desire. This includes changing the access levels of individuals or removing them from it altogether.

Use caution when deciding who to give Editor access to your file. However, you have the option to turn off the abilities of Editors to change permissions and sharing.

- Click the gear icon in the sharing dialog box of your file and uncheck “Editors can change permissions and share.” This ability is not available for files in shared drives.

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

#### General access

Shareable links can be used to share files with a broader audience or specific people. These links are accessible and customizable under General access in the sharing dialog box.

When you click Copy link, a shared link is copied. Link sharing is useful for sharing non-sensitive files that require quick attention or with large numbers of colleagues who need access to a file. If link sharing is used, by default, this link is set to Restricted, so only people you’ve shared the file with can access the link.

When you share a link to a file in My Drive or a shared drive, you control how widely the file is shared:

- Restricted: Only specific people you share the file with will be able to access it.
- ith the link: Anyone on the internet who has the link can access your file without signing in to a Google account. Link access can be set to Viewer, Commenter, or Editor permissions.
- Tip: Expiration dates can be set for individuals with whom you share your files.

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

#### Sharing Externally to Collaborators Without Google Accounts

It is recommended that external collaborators either use or create a Google account, as it is the most secure way to collaborate with them. If you want to share with someone who does not use a Google account and is unable or unwilling to create one, there are two options:

- Visitor sharing: Invite them as a collaborator to the file with PIN-based sharing.
- Link sharing: Set link sharing to “Anyone with the link” and share the link with them.

When you are sharing with a non-Google account, we strongly recommend using visitor sharing. With visitor sharing, you can share items with non-Google accounts, enabling them to view, comment on, or edit content in Google Drive (My Drive and shared drives) and Sites using a secure PIN code.

You, as a file owner, can view detailed activity on your files and revoke access from the Drive sharing dialog at any time.

- NOTE: Visitors can edit, comment on, or view your files for seven days after they verify their email address. After seven days, they will need to reverify using the original shared link in their email invite, so it's best to remind them to save the email!
- If a visitor would like to upgrade from a visitor session to a Google account with the same email address, they will need to first delete their visitor session and then create a Google account

## IDrive

<h3 id="google-drive-vs-idrive" align="center"><a href="https://www.cloudwards.net/google-drive-vs-idrive/"><strong>Google Drive vs IDrive</strong></a>
</h3>

> Google Drive is one of the best cloud storage services, while IDrive tops our best online backup rankings

Generally speaking, though, you can safely assume that IDrive is your best bet when it comes to online backup, while Google Drive is your go-to when you want to work with others online.

#### Backup

- IDrive is the undisputed champion of backup compared to other providers in the field
- IDrive offers more features than any other provider...and it can backup all manner of devices and operating systems. The only exception is anything running on Linux.
- When it comes to backing up your files, you can do so in several ways: on the level of individual files or — if you’re more the set-it-and-forget-it type — on the level of folders or even entire disks
- the service also supports block-level file copying. This means it scans all files before uploading and then only transfers the bits that have been changed, which saves you both time and resources

#### Google Drive Backup & Sync

- While Google’s Backup and Sync works well enough, it just doesn’t pack the same punch as IDrive does and offers far fewer options. That said, it’s a great way to backup your files for free, so we won’t discount it altogether
- if you just need to backup a few files, Google Drive is better, as it offers 15GB for free, as opposed to IDrive’s 10GB of free storage space
- if you have less than 15GB worth of files that you need backed up and you don’t need too many options when sending them into the cloud, Google Drive is an OK backup alternative

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

#### Syncing Files

- IDrive offers some pretty decent syncing abilities, but it’s no match for Google - Google Drive is one of the best syncing solutions out there
- any file you have linked on either your computer or in the cloud changes across all devices when you change a single copy
- It’s an incredibly handy feature and IDrive is one of the few backup services that has it
- IDrive’s syncing abilities are a cut above even those of many storage providers, though Dropbox outperforms it in this category
- There’s also no cap on the file size, making IDrive a great way to send large files
- However, Google Drive just does a better job. It lets you sync files from every device imaginable, sometimes even sweeping up files you had no intention of moving into the cloud
- It also packs in a number of its apps into this process, most notably Google Photos, which uploads every pic you take into the cloud
- Besides pictures, Google also syncs docs and spreadsheets, and it can even sync files other people are working on
- IDrive’s sync, while pretty good, just can’t hold a candle to Google Drive’s

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

#### Sharing and Collaboration

- While IDrive can share files, it’s basically just a glorified transfer service. Google Drive can share, collaborate in real time and do a host of other things
- Although it’s not perfect, it’s a fantastic overall tool
- Sharing with Google Drive is easy, and it offers a lot more options than IDrive does, including the option to restrict people from certain content as well as to share files across a whole organization
- Drive offers everything you could need from a basic productivity suite: a word processor, a spreadsheet program, a presentation maker and more

#### Security

...how well each service protects your files from outside meddling

- Although both encrypt your files at rest, Google goes with 128-bit AES, while IDrive uses 256-bit. That’s not a huge difference, though it might disqualify Google Drive for the very security conscious
- a bigger issue is that IDrive allows you to use zero-knowledge encryption, while Google does not
- This deficiency makes your files vulnerable to mischief by Google’s employees, but also to third parties if they were ever able to gain access to where Google stores its users’ passwords
- Google is slightly weaker at-rest encryption

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

#### Privacy

- As a company that makes most of its money from ads, Google has a terrible privacy policy and will actively scan your Drive files to find out more about you.
- IDrive doesn’t do thisIDrive has a privacy policy that’s fully compliant with the EU’s GDPR regulations as well as the U.S. healthcare rules enshrined in HIPAA.
- if you switch on zero-knowledge encryption, you should be alright in this case, as IDrive might hand over your files to authorities if served a warrant, but not your password as it doesn’t have access to it

#### Google and Privacy

- There are many revelations concerning the way Google uses data from users’ private files and devices
- Google doesn’t use zero-knowledge encryption, so we generally recommend that you don’t store sensitive data on Google’s servers unless you enable it yourself using some of the best encryption software, like Boxcryptor

However, no matter how you slice it, IDrive has a lot more built-in privacy, so it ultimately takes the cake without any real argument.

- Click the Opened tab to see file requests that are still pending. Click the send email icon (paper airplane) next to a file request to share it via email, or click the link icon (chainlink) to copy a link to share.
- Click the Closed tab to see files requests that have expired or that you’ve closed. Click “…” (ellipsis) next to the name of a request to reopen it.

You can create new file requests by clicking File requests in the left sidebar, then clicking New request above the file request list.

**Deleted files**

Access files and folders you’ve deleted from your account, grouped by date.

- Click the name of a file or folder to restore it. If multiple files were deleted on the same day, you can choose from a list of files to restore.

By clicking Deleted files in the left sidebar you can filter deleted files by date, user, and folder.

Note: The amount of time Dropbox stores deleted files depends on your plan.

</h3>

Shared folders in Dropbox give teams a common work area to gather key files, create to-do lists, edit and comment on documents, and more.

Dropbox is best known as a cloud storage service, but it also offers some collaboration tools. For example, you and your co-workers can add comments to files and create shared to-do lists. These functions are available with all Dropbox individual user plans (including both free and paid versions) and team accounts for business.

> It makes no sense to cover dropbox if you can not collaborate and share on the free plan!
