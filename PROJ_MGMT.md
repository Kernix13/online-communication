Asana is one of the most powerful and popular project management tools. It helps teams and individuals get organized and seamlessly bring together their tasks and projects.

#### Getting started with Asana

- Go to the [Asana sign-up page](https://asana.grsm.io/crynh0hq4hno) to create an account
- Asana has a very generous free tier. It has all the core features most people will need and is a great way to start learning Asana for free
- Once you confirm your account, Asana will take you through a brief wizard asking you what your roles are, such as team member or team leader. You can skip this if you like, as all options can be changed later anyway.
- Once on the main screen, you can get started organizing your projects and tasks

#### Create a project

1. Go to the left-hand menu and select Create A Project
1. You will be presented with a choice of either a blank project or to choose a pre-made template
1. Projects are your primary top-level container within Asana, and all related tasks and team members are contained within a project
1. Give your project a name and other details
1. You can also choose the view you prefer
1. Click Continue to finish
1. You will then select Go To Project, which will open the page for your new Project where you can start adding tasks and team members

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

#### Sections

1. Start now by adding Sections
   1. Sections in Asana are the next level down from Projects. This is how you begin breaking down your projects into smaller, more manageable pieces.
1. Click on Add A Section and enter a name

#### Tasks

1. Start to add Tasks in Asana. These are the individual items needed to complete a Section
   1. Asana helps break your larger projects down into smaller bite-sized tasks that are much easier to manage and track, all from one interface
1. Name your Task, then move to the right under Assignee. Click on the open area and select yourself or any team member you like
1. Then do the same for the due date. A due date is not needed if the task is ongoing
1. Click on Details next to the Task. This will open a window on the right. Here, you can add instructions or notes for either yourself or other team members

This section can also be used for all communications pertaining to this project. Each team member can ask or answer questions here in the comments section. All communications are then held in one place, which is much more efficient than email threads.

#### Subtasks

You can dive in even further and add Subtasks:

- Click on Subtask and add additional steps to help complete the Tasks
- Subtasks are not needed but are a great way to make larger tasks more manageable, especially when assigning them to other team members

#### Further organizing in Asana

Other features within Asana: the different views available

- At the top, you can quickly switch between views

List view:

- This is your standard view familiar to most people accustomed to using a physical planner or who are coming from other software programs

Board view:

- For those who prefer a Kanban-style layout, you can use the Board view and drag your Tasks between Sections as they are completed
- This is one of the key reasons for having Sections in Asana, and it works similar to an agile workflow for software development

Calendar view:

- This arranges all your items on a calendar to give you a look at what you have coming up or due soon

Timeline view:

> This is only available for Premium accounts

#### Color-coding items in Asana

...for color-coding all elements of a Project

- Click the drop-down arrow next to a Project name
- Here you can select a color for that specific project
- The benefit of color-coding your projects is that when in Calendar mode or other modes, you can easily see which Projects are coming up at a glance. The same goes for Board view as well

#### Completing tasks in Asana

- When any Task or Subtask is completed, the Assignee can click on the small checkmark icon next to the item
- This can be done from any view and at any time
- This can also be undone by simply clicking the checkmark again.
- It’s also a good idea to add a note in the details section regarding the completion of the task

</h3>

Asana is a project management tool that offers managers and their teams a place in the cloud to create virtual workspaces and collaborate on projects. It allows team leaders to break projects down into tasks, assign them to team members, mark deadlines to set expectations, assign priority levels, and indicate which tasks have dependencies.

Asana minimizes the need for email by providing the project team with a host of useful collaboration features such as commenting, file sharing, marking tasks as complete or incomplete, and even social media-style features such as the “like” button.

Users follow the progress of their projects through notifications that appear in their email inbox and the notifications section in Asana. These notifications inform team members of upcoming deadlines, assigned tasks, overdue tasks, interactions made with their tasks, etc.

#### Create an Asana Account

1. Go to asana.com to sign up for a free Basic account
1. When you select your plan, you’ll be prompted to enter your email address.
1. Submit your email and verify your account via the link sent by Asana to your email inbox

#### Create a Project

1. Answer a few quick questions to help Asana determine how to get you started most efficiently
1. Describe the kind of project you’re working on and select a name for it
1. Alternatively, you can start a new project using the + sign at the top right for a more customized approach
1. You can select a blank project or use an existing template
1. After naming your first project, you can name your task headers based on your requirements. A typical header arrangement is Pending/To-do, In Process/Doing, and Completed/Done
1. Select your default project view. When you choose a layout here, it becomes the first view you see when you open this project the next time
1. You can adding team members here if you want

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

#### Add a task

The next logical step would be to break the project down into tasks and add them to your Asana project. Each of the layout options provides its own ways to add tasks to it.

_List view_:

- The List view is a simple yet effective way to look at your project.
- The layout divides your project into sections, with each section containing its own set of tasks.
- The task name, assignee, deadline, and priority are all easily visible for each task in this layout.
- In the List view, click the Add task button just under the project’s name above the task list

_Board view_:

- This view allows each task to be represented as a card on a board, separated by section, indicated by adjacent columns.
- Each card displays the task’s name, assignee, and deadline.
- The section names are typically status update labels such as Pending, In Progress, and Completed.
- Users move cards from one column to the next based on the task’s progress.
- In the Board view, you can add tasks by simply navigating to the bottom of any of the sections and clicking the Add Task button

_Calendar view_:

- The calendar layout is date-focused and has an overlay of a project’s tasks on a calendar template.
- This project view is beneficial when a project manager is looking to optimize timelines and is reviewing the amount of work being completed on particular days of the month.
- This layout can help a manager balance any inconsistencies or inefficiencies in how the work is assigned or completed.
- In the Calendar view, tasks can be added by clicking on the day when the task is supposed to be initiated or closed, depending on how you phrase it

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

#### Collaborate with Team Members

_Team Communication_:

Team collaboration is an essential part of what makes Asana a powerful project management tool. It allows for real-time communication between your team members no matter where they are. Users can comment on tasks, share files, and acknowledge each other’s efforts by “liking” updates. This eliminates the need for email and chat apps by combining their functions on the same platform, saving your team time and money.

_Meeting Management_:

Meetings are more productive and effective with Asana. Team members can work together on meeting agendas where they can add notes against each point of discussion as a meeting progresses. Once a session is over, project managers can assign follow-up tasks to relevant team members for further action.

#### Integrate With Your Favorite Apps

It wouldn’t be wrong to say an app is only as good as its integrations. Asana has a rich library of app integrations with a broad range of partners, including Slack, Outlook, Gmail, MS Office 365, Google Calendar, and more. This enables Asana users to pick up tasks from within these apps and facilitates a seamless project management experience for all stakeholders involved

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

#### Save Time With Workflows

A workflow is a standardized way of doing something at your organization. For example, does your organization follow a standard procedure for finance approvals? How about the way you approach marketing plans or hire new talent? With Asana, you can define standard workflows or templates for your teams to follow in the future. This saves time and effort and makes it easy for any new employees to join your team and hit the ground running.

Standardized workflows also help project managers assess the performance of their teams against a standardized template that provides a level playing field to all team members.

#### Common Problems When Using Asana

- New users can feel overwhelmed because of the number of functions and options available
- As a result, organizations may have to set aside more budgets for user onboarding and training.
- For new users to use Asana as an effective tool, they need onboarding training, which takes additional time and money
- The sheer number of options and features in Asana may seem like an advantage initially, but it may be overkill for managers handling basic projects.
- In addition, some users have complained of decision fatigue in the past when using the software
- Even though Asana is an excellent tool for organizing and tracking projects and tasks, it doesn’t offer time tracking features critical for project managers.
- This means project managers cannot track the time spent by each team member on the tasks assigned to them.
- This somewhat limits to what degree a project manager can optimize their team’s performance.
- Moreover, if teams need to bill their clients and categorize their work into billable and non-billable time, they would have to use a different tool to track time
- Asana only allows for exports in the JSON and CSV formats. The all-important PDF and Excel formats are not part of the deal yet

#### Trello vs Asana

Compared to Asana, Trello is more visually pleasing in terms of layouts and structures.

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

<h3 id="how-to-use-asana-for-project-management" align="center"><a href="https://www.getclockwise.com/blog/asana-project-management"><strong>How to use Asana for project management</strong></a>
</h3>

Asana is project management software that helps teams carry out their projects and initiatives from beginning to end. It allows you to keep all work and communications in one place, which means less switching between an endless number of windows and more time moving your project ahead.

#### Asana’s core features

- **Goals**: We all know that setting clear and measurable goals (OKRs) is one of the keys to keeping a company or team aligned and focused on what’s most important. With Goals in Asana, not only can you keep your company-wide goals and sub-goals in one easy-to-reference place, but you can also connect each goal to the work and the people that’ll see that goal to its fruition. Not to mention that this feature makes it easier to track a goal’s progress, so you always know where you stand.
- **Timeline**: View your project as a timeline (Gantt chart), perfect for tracking how different tasks relate to each other and the overall vision for a project.
- **Portfolios**: Ideal for reporting purposes, this feature makes it easy to track progress from a high-level and share it with stakeholders.
- **Workload**: Take care of your team members by seeing what’s on everyone’s plate and making sure everyone has a well-balanced workload.
- **Forms**: When work requests are coming in hot, the best thing you can do is standardize the process to be more streamlined and less overwhelming. Forms help you do just that.
- **Automations**: Repetitive busywork is the bane of productivity! Asana lets you let custom automations do the work for you.

#### Who is Asana made for

Asana has a track record for being versatile, with features that serve a wide range of teams and workflows:

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

#### How do I get started

1. Get set up to collaborate: After creating your Asana account, the way to link up with other members and collaborate is through an Organization or Workspace. Organizations are for people who share the same professional email domain and want the ability to break off into Teams, while Workspaces are for individuals who sign up for Asana with their personal email addresses
1. Create your team: If you created a Workspace, skip this step since Workspaces function as their own Teams. However, if you created an Organization, Teams are the next level of hierarchy. Teams are exactly what they sound like: subdivisions of the entire organization. How you organize teams is up to you, but you might have a team for every department, such as IT, sales, etc.
1. Create your project: One of the best things about Asana is that they have a huge library of ready-made templates for you to get started creating a project.
1. Organize your project with tasks: After you’ve set up your project, start populating your project with tasks. Tasks represent an action that needs to be done in order to make progress on the project. You can even add details to each task card to provide even more context and keep all the relevant information in one place. For even more hierarchy and organization power, you can group related tasks under “sections” and subdivide each task into subtasks.
1. Refine your workflow: Once your project and its contents are laid out, you and your team can start creating a game plan for how you’ll get things done. A great place to start on this workflow refinement process is by using Asana’s views feature. Switch between board view, list view, timeline view, and calendar view. Each view literally lets you see your project from different perspectives, those of which can inform the way you tackle the work in front of you.
1. Customize: You can start customizing the platform with custom fields, automations (“rules”), and anything else that helps your team stay organized, focused, and on track. With your project, tasks, and workflow all set up in the Asana platform, you and your team should be ready to forge ahead on your goals and initiatives.

#### Asana integrations

Asana offers an array of integrations. There are the integrations that are essential for everyone, no matter their industry or department like Gmail, Google Drive, Microsoft Teams, and Slack. Then, there are the integrations that are a little bit more specialized but are still absolutely necessary for certain people — like Jira Cloud, Adobe Creative Cloud, and Asana for Salesforce.

> Basic is Asana’s free plan, and it works best for small teams “just getting started with project management” — according to Asana’s website. It comes with unlimited tasks, projects, messages, and file storage (although each file needs to be 100MB or less). As the free plan, however, it does have its limitations. For example, teams can include no more than 15 members. And while Asana Basic lets you switch between List, Board, and Calendar Views, most notably it doesn’t allow access to Timeline View — a really helpful (albeit, necessary) component of project management.
