## Free Project Management Tools

If you are not familiar with project management then these tools will not be easy to learn fast. I would only spend time learning them if you see them as bullet points in jobs openings that you apply to.

<h3 id="beginners-guide-on-how-to-use-asana" align="center"><a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-use-asana/"><strong>Beginners Guide on How to use Asana</strong></a>
</h3>

Asana is one of the most powerful and popular project management tools. It helps teams and individuals get organized and seamlessly bring together their tasks and projects.

#### Getting started with Asana

- Go to the [Asana sign-up page](https://asana.grsm.io/crynh0hq4hno) to create an account
- Asana has a very generous free tier. It has all the core features most people will need and is a great way to start learning Asana for free
- Once you confirm your account, Asana will take you through a brief wizard asking you what your roles are, such as team member or team leader. You can skip this if you like, as all options can be changed later anyway.
- Once on the main screen, you can get started organizing your projects and tasks

#### Create a project

1. Go to the left-hand menu and select Create A Project
1. You will be presented with a choice of either a blank project or to choose a pre-made template
1. Projects are your primary top-level container within Asana, and all related tasks and team members are contained within a project
1. Give your project a name and other details
1. You can also choose the view you prefer
1. Click Continue to finish
1. You will then select Go To Project, which will open the page for your new Project where you can start adding tasks and team members

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

#### Sections

1. Start now by adding Sections
   1. Sections in Asana are the next level down from Projects. This is how you begin breaking down your projects into smaller, more manageable pieces.
1. Click on Add A Section and enter a name

#### Tasks

1. Start to add Tasks in Asana. These are the individual items needed to complete a Section
   1. Asana helps break your larger projects down into smaller bite-sized tasks that are much easier to manage and track, all from one interface
1. Name your Task, then move to the right under Assignee. Click on the open area and select yourself or any team member you like
1. Then do the same for the due date. A due date is not needed if the task is ongoing
1. Click on Details next to the Task. This will open a window on the right. Here, you can add instructions or notes for either yourself or other team members

This section can also be used for all communications pertaining to this project. Each team member can ask or answer questions here in the comments section. All communications are then held in one place, which is much more efficient than email threads.

#### Subtasks

You can dive in even further and add Subtasks:

- Click on Subtask and add additional steps to help complete the Tasks
- Subtasks are not needed but are a great way to make larger tasks more manageable, especially when assigning them to other team members

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

#### Further organizing in Asana

Other features within Asana: the different views available

- At the top, you can quickly switch between views

List view:

- This is your standard view familiar to most people accustomed to using a physical planner or who are coming from other software programs

Board view:

- For those who prefer a Kanban-style layout, you can use the Board view and drag your Tasks between Sections as they are completed
- This is one of the key reasons for having Sections in Asana, and it works similar to an agile workflow for software development

Calendar view:

- This arranges all your items on a calendar to give you a look at what you have coming up or due soon

Timeline view:

> This is only available for Premium accounts

#### Color-coding items in Asana

...for color-coding all elements of a Project

- Click the drop-down arrow next to a Project name
- Here you can select a color for that specific project
- The benefit of color-coding your projects is that when in Calendar mode or other modes, you can easily see which Projects are coming up at a glance. The same goes for Board view as well

#### Completing tasks in Asana

- When any Task or Subtask is completed, the Assignee can click on the small checkmark icon next to the item
- This can be done from any view and at any time
- This can also be undone by simply clicking the checkmark again.
- It’s also a good idea to add a note in the details section regarding the completion of the task

<h3 id="how-to-use-asana" align="center"><a href="https://nira.com/how-to-use-asana/"><strong>How to Use Asana</strong></a>
</h3>

Asana is a project management tool that offers managers and their teams a place in the cloud to create virtual workspaces and collaborate on projects. It allows team leaders to break projects down into tasks, assign them to team members, mark deadlines to set expectations, assign priority levels, and indicate which tasks have dependencies.

Asana minimizes the need for email by providing the project team with a host of useful collaboration features such as commenting, file sharing, marking tasks as complete or incomplete, and even social media-style features such as the “like” button.

Users follow the progress of their projects through notifications that appear in their email inbox and the notifications section in Asana. These notifications inform team members of upcoming deadlines, assigned tasks, overdue tasks, interactions made with their tasks, etc.

#### Create an Asana Account

1. Go to asana.com to sign up for a free Basic account
1. When you select your plan, you’ll be prompted to enter your email address.
1. Submit your email and verify your account via the link sent by Asana to your email inbox

#### Create a Project

1. Answer a few quick questions to help Asana determine how to get you started most efficiently
1. Describe the kind of project you’re working on and select a name for it
1. Alternatively, you can start a new project using the + sign at the top right for a more customized approach
1. You can select a blank project or use an existing template
1. After naming your first project, you can name your task headers based on your requirements. A typical header arrangement is Pending/To-do, In Process/Doing, and Completed/Done
1. Select your default project view. When you choose a layout here, it becomes the first view you see when you open this project the next time
1. You can adding team members here if you want

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

#### Add a task

The next logical step would be to break the project down into tasks and add them to your Asana project. Each of the layout options provides its own ways to add tasks to it.

_List view_:

- The List view is a simple yet effective way to look at your project.
- The layout divides your project into sections, with each section containing its own set of tasks.
- The task name, assignee, deadline, and priority are all easily visible for each task in this layout.
- In the List view, click the Add task button just under the project’s name above the task list

_Board view_:

- This view allows each task to be represented as a card on a board, separated by section, indicated by adjacent columns.
- Each card displays the task’s name, assignee, and deadline.
- The section names are typically status update labels such as Pending, In Progress, and Completed.
- Users move cards from one column to the next based on the task’s progress.
- In the Board view, you can add tasks by simply navigating to the bottom of any of the sections and clicking the Add Task button

_Calendar view_:

- The calendar layout is date-focused and has an overlay of a project’s tasks on a calendar template.
- This project view is beneficial when a project manager is looking to optimize timelines and is reviewing the amount of work being completed on particular days of the month.
- This layout can help a manager balance any inconsistencies or inefficiencies in how the work is assigned or completed.
- In the Calendar view, tasks can be added by clicking on the day when the task is supposed to be initiated or closed, depending on how you phrase it

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

#### Collaborate with Team Members

_Team Communication_:

Team collaboration is an essential part of what makes Asana a powerful project management tool. It allows for real-time communication between your team members no matter where they are. Users can comment on tasks, share files, and acknowledge each other’s efforts by “liking” updates. This eliminates the need for email and chat apps by combining their functions on the same platform, saving your team time and money.

_Meeting Management_:

Meetings are more productive and effective with Asana. Team members can work together on meeting agendas where they can add notes against each point of discussion as a meeting progresses. Once a session is over, project managers can assign follow-up tasks to relevant team members for further action.

#### Integrate With Your Favorite Apps

It wouldn’t be wrong to say an app is only as good as its integrations. Asana has a rich library of app integrations with a broad range of partners, including Slack, Outlook, Gmail, MS Office 365, Google Calendar, and more. This enables Asana users to pick up tasks from within these apps and facilitates a seamless project management experience for all stakeholders involved

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

#### Save Time With Workflows

A workflow is a standardized way of doing something at your organization. For example, does your organization follow a standard procedure for finance approvals? How about the way you approach marketing plans or hire new talent? With Asana, you can define standard workflows or templates for your teams to follow in the future. This saves time and effort and makes it easy for any new employees to join your team and hit the ground running.

Standardized workflows also help project managers assess the performance of their teams against a standardized template that provides a level playing field to all team members.

#### Common Problems When Using Asana

- New users can feel overwhelmed because of the number of functions and options available
- As a result, organizations may have to set aside more budgets for user onboarding and training.
- For new users to use Asana as an effective tool, they need onboarding training, which takes additional time and money
- The sheer number of options and features in Asana may seem like an advantage initially, but it may be overkill for managers handling basic projects.
- In addition, some users have complained of decision fatigue in the past when using the software
- Even though Asana is an excellent tool for organizing and tracking projects and tasks, it doesn’t offer time tracking features critical for project managers.
- This means project managers cannot track the time spent by each team member on the tasks assigned to them.
- This somewhat limits to what degree a project manager can optimize their team’s performance.
- Moreover, if teams need to bill their clients and categorize their work into billable and non-billable time, they would have to use a different tool to track time
- Asana only allows for exports in the JSON and CSV formats. The all-important PDF and Excel formats are not part of the deal yet

#### Trello vs Asana

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

<h3 id="how-to-use-asana-for-project-management" align="center"><a href="https://www.getclockwise.com/blog/asana-project-management"><strong>How to use Asana for project management</strong></a>
</h3>

Asana is project management software that helps teams carry out their projects and initiatives from beginning to end. It allows you to keep all work and communications in one place, which means less switching between an endless number of windows and more time moving your project ahead.

#### Asana’s core features

- **Goals**: We all know that setting clear and measurable goals (OKRs) is one of the keys to keeping a company or team aligned and focused on what’s most important. With Goals in Asana, not only can you keep your company-wide goals and sub-goals in one easy-to-reference place, but you can also connect each goal to the work and the people that’ll see that goal to its fruition. Not to mention that this feature makes it easier to track a goal’s progress, so you always know where you stand.
- **Timeline**: View your project as a timeline (Gantt chart), perfect for tracking how different tasks relate to each other and the overall vision for a project.
- **Portfolios**: Ideal for reporting purposes, this feature makes it easy to track progress from a high-level and share it with stakeholders.
- **Workload**: Take care of your team members by seeing what’s on everyone’s plate and making sure everyone has a well-balanced workload.
- **Forms**: When work requests are coming in hot, the best thing you can do is standardize the process to be more streamlined and less overwhelming. Forms help you do just that.
- **Automations**: Repetitive busywork is the bane of productivity! Asana lets you let custom automations do the work for you.

#### Who is Asana made for

Asana has a track record for being versatile, with features that serve a wide range of teams and workflows:

- Marketing | Sales | Operations | Design | Product | IT departments | Human resources | Finance | Engineering | Event planners

#### Asana features for project management

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

#### How do I get started

1. Get set up to collaborate: After creating your Asana account, the way to link up with other members and collaborate is through an Organization or Workspace. Organizations are for people who share the same professional email domain and want the ability to break off into Teams, while Workspaces are for individuals who sign up for Asana with their personal email addresses
1. Create your team: If you created a Workspace, skip this step since Workspaces function as their own Teams. However, if you created an Organization, Teams are the next level of hierarchy. Teams are exactly what they sound like: subdivisions of the entire organization. How you organize teams is up to you, but you might have a team for every department, such as IT, sales, etc.
1. Create your project: One of the best things about Asana is that they have a huge library of ready-made templates for you to get started creating a project.
1. Organize your project with tasks: After you’ve set up your project, start populating your project with tasks. Tasks represent an action that needs to be done in order to make progress on the project. You can even add details to each task card to provide even more context and keep all the relevant information in one place. For even more hierarchy and organization power, you can group related tasks under “sections” and subdivide each task into subtasks.
1. Refine your workflow: Once your project and its contents are laid out, you and your team can start creating a game plan for how you’ll get things done. A great place to start on this workflow refinement process is by using Asana’s views feature. Switch between board view, list view, timeline view, and calendar view. Each view literally lets you see your project from different perspectives, those of which can inform the way you tackle the work in front of you.
1. Customize: You can start customizing the platform with custom fields, automations (“rules”), and anything else that helps your team stay organized, focused, and on track. With your project, tasks, and workflow all set up in the Asana platform, you and your team should be ready to forge ahead on your goals and initiatives.

#### Asana integrations

Asana offers an array of integrations. There are the integrations that are essential for everyone, no matter their industry or department like Gmail, Google Drive, Microsoft Teams, and Slack. Then, there are the integrations that are a little bit more specialized but are still absolutely necessary for certain people — like Jira Cloud, Adobe Creative Cloud, and Asana for Salesforce.

> Basic is Asana’s free plan, and it works best for small teams “just getting started with project management” — according to Asana’s website. It comes with unlimited tasks, projects, messages, and file storage (although each file needs to be 100MB or less). As the free plan, however, it does have its limitations. For example, teams can include no more than 15 members. And while Asana Basic lets you switch between List, Board, and Calendar Views, most notably it doesn’t allow access to Timeline View — a really helpful (albeit, necessary) component of project management.

## Monday dot com

<h3 id="get-started-with-monday.com" align="center"><a href="https://support.monday.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005305649-Get-started-with-monday-com"><strong>Get started with monday.com</strong></a>
</h3>

#### Everything starts with a board

Boards are made up of items, subitems, groups, and columns. Items can be clients, deals, meetings, purchases, and more. Each item on the board will track one instance

- To create a new board, click "+ Add" in your left panel.
- Next, name your board, select the board's privacy level, and then choose what you'd like to call your items
- Add columns to organize important details, like email addresses, locations, and the status of an item.
- Sort items into groups for more structure.
- You can customize all boards to your needs.
- Or use a template

#### Start collaborating

These are the basic elements of managing any board:

- Assign items: With permission, all team members can see every aspect of a project and jump in to collaborate — but first, assigning ownership is key. Use the People Column to assign items. The person assigned will receive a notification about the assignment.
- Communicate: Use the updates section to keep everyone informed about how the item is progressing; ask questions, write updates, and attach images or files. To make it fun, add GIFs, emojis, and @mention teammates.
- Track your progress: Use the status column to record your progress. Nothing beats seeing your whole column turn the same color when everything is done! Green is our personal favorite.

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

#### Enhance your board with views

You can add views to enhance the performance of your board or to gain valuable insights. Use The Form View to automatically collect survey responses on your board, The Files View to review a gallery of your files and annotate those that are still in progress, or The Chart View to visualize your board's data. There are many more to choose from.

#### Integrations

Try adding integrations and automations to your workflow. These tools are the perfect way to eliminate manual work. With automations, the possibilities are limitless. And some of our most popular integrations are our most versatile— like the Gmail and Outlook integrations.

#### Dashboards

Once you have your workflow built out across multiple boards, you can use dashboards to see all of your data at a high level. Dashboards are capable of integrating data from multiple boards into one view. This is a great way to make comparisons and measure team performance.

#### monday workdocs

One of our best tools for collaborating and brainstorming is monday workdocs. Workdocs are a flexible, multi-media whiteboard. By adding individual elements to your workdoc, you can record your every thought where the rest of your work is stored.

Each element is flexible and can be transformed, moved up or down, duplicated, deleted, and more. And once you're ready to start organizing your ideas for that next big project, you can begin creating items from directly within the doc.

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

<h3 id="how-to-use-monday.com" align="center"><a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-use-monday/"><strong>how-to-use-monday.com</strong></a>
</h3>

monday.com is a platform geared toward helping businesses better manage projects. That, of course, is only one aspect of the service. You’ll find it can also serve as a CRM, an ad campaign manager, bug tracking, customer project management and so much more. When you think of monday.com, you should really consider it more of a process manager than a task manager, because it can do so much more than your typical project management tool:

- Project and task management | Marketing workflows | Finance requests | Sales | Design planning | Operations | IT requests | Recruitment pipelines

#### What is monday.com work management

Essentially, work management functions to help organizations achieve a much higher operational efficiency by helping you keep track of projects and workflows, visualize data and empower collaboration between teams.

Work management tools make use of automation and third-party integration to achieve this, and monday.com’s work management platform does a brilliant job of bringing it all together to form a cohesive whole that will help your business in ways you might never have considered.

#### How to use the monday.com work management workflow

After you’ve [signed up for your monday.com account](https://mondaycom.grsm.io/3uhseotoqzq9), the first thing you must do is create a new workspace. A workspace is a centralized location that houses all the tools you need to manage your workflows.

Once you sign up, you’ll need to walk through a wizard that will ask you several simple questions (Figure A). One such question asks what you’d like to focus on first. Remember, the first part of the question is important, as you can always make changes after you’ve set up your account.

- Once you’ve finished the setup, you’ll find yourself in your new workspace on your new board
- Once created, your new workspace will only include two views — what those views are will depend on the choices you made during the setup process
- To add a new view, click + directly to the right of Timeline. This will open a drop-down list of other views you can add
- You can then give that view a name or leave it as the default
- Depending on your work management needs, you might need to add more views

#### Multiple views

Play around with adding and removing different views to set up the exact tools you need to satisfy your work management needs. You might find you only need one or two views or maybe your workflow requires the addition of all eight views and even a few additional apps. The important thing is that you customize your workspace to perfectly fit your management needs.

One thing to keep in mind is some of the views can be further customized. For example, the Dashboard view allows you to add and remove widgets to create the perfect visualization of your workspace data. After adding the Dashboard view, click + Add Widget and select from the list of widgets to add to the view.

One of the best views with which to start building your workflows is the Main Table. As you build your Main Table, it will fill out elements for the other views.

The important thing to understanding how monday.com work management flows is that you must take the time upfront to not only construct your workspaces exactly as you need them but to customize the views such that they will best serve your workflows. By giving yourself ample time to build your workspace before you start adding team members, the management of your work will be considerably easier.

At the same time, you’ll probably find as your projects and work continue to grow that you might need more than one workspace. You can create separate workspaces for each team or project and then customize those workspaces to better fit their needs.

Once you’ve built those workspaces, it’s time to start inviting teammates for collaboration. Make sure you invite the correct teammates to the right workspaces. You can invite teammates by clicking Invite in the upper right corner of the workspace. Once the members have joined, you can start assigning them tasks and they can begin collaborating on the workflow.

</h3>

Check out their [monday.com review](https://www.cloudwards.net/monday-com-review/)

- head to the website and click the big “get started” button
- After that, you’ll see a screen where you need to enter your email address
- In the next screen, enter your full name, a password as well as your team’s name
- After that is one more screen where monday.com will check what you’ll be using the software for, as well as the size of your team and what kind of business you’re in

#### Getting Started with Monday.com

Once you have your account set up and you’re in the interface, you’ll be greeted by helpful pop-ups. If you’re used to basic, free project management tools like Trello or Asana, then monday.com’s main table will be quite a shock at first. There are just so many more functions and options presented here that they can’t be jumbled together into a single coherent whole.

However, this board serves mainly as a way for monday.com to showcase what it can do. It’s probably best to start very simply and just create a new board. To do so,

- go to the top left of the screen and click the “add” button next to the “+” symbol in a circle
- You’ll get a pop-up, in which you need to set a name for the new board and specify whether it’s a main board or a private one. This affects who can see and use it: “main” means anybody in the organization that’s already using monday.com, while “private” means it’s by invitation only
- you’ll be met with a new screen that has two “groups” and five “tasks” filled in for you, so the board is not entirely blank

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

#### Adding Groups to a Board

...a “group” is a project I think, while a “task” will be a component of getting it done

- To add a new group to the board, click on the blue arrow next to the box that says “new item” and select the option for “new group of items.”
- The new group will pop up above your old ones and be untitled. We’ll rename it, then we want to move it to the bottom - you need to hover over the downward arrow to the left of the group’s name until an icon with two arrows shows up, as well as a little grid
- Click and hold onto the grid, and a small menu will appear

#### Adding Tasks to a Group

There are two ways to do so: either by using the big blue button at the top that we used earlier, or by clicking on the “add” button in the task space below the group name.

- group-specific options: Click the downward arrow next to the group name and watch the dropdown menu unfold
- This menu is where you can collapse a specific group or collapse all of them, as well as create a new group or move it to another board.
- You can also change a group’s color and rename the group

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

#### Organizing Your Monday.com Board and Team

With the groups in place, you can assign people to work on them, set dates and a lot more.

- Columns: Organizing groups and tasks is done through columns
- Groups come preloaded with columns though you can remove them and swap them out
- To do so, hover over the name of the column and you’ll see a dropdown arrow appear
- You can add checkmarks, item IDs for inventory and locations that can be linked to a map. You can even add interactive items like votes

#### Teammates

- First, you need to add them to the board. You can do this by going to the bottom left of the screen and hitting the silhouette with a “+” sign in the sidebar.
- A pop-up will appear that lets you either invite people using a link or by sending an email
- To assign people to a task, just go to the task you want to add people to and click on the silhouette.
- A small window will appear with all the people assigned to the board
- A colored circle with the person’s initials will appear where the silhouette was and they are officially assigned to the task
- To remove somebody from a task, just click on the circle with their initials and then on the “x” behind their name in the window that pops up.
- You can add and remove people from tasks as much as you want

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

#### Add Statuses and Dates

Most columns work much the same way as the one for teammates does, with the main menu being in the title. The “status” is a bar that you can add to each task that gives you three preset statuses to pick from (“working on it,” “stuck” and “done”) with the option of adding your own as well. The bar at the bottom of each group of tasks will change color as you assign statuses.

Just click on the field for the task you want to assign a date to and a calendar will pop up. You can also add a specific time if you’d like.

#### The Monday.com Dashboard

The best way to keep track of what’s happening on a board, especially if you have more than one, is by using a dashboard. To create a dashboard:

- go to the “add” button on the left and pick “new dashboard”
- You’ll be presented with a pop-up where you can add the new dasboard’s name and whether it’s public or private

Once done, you’ll see your new blank dashboard. To make any use of it, you’ll need to add what monday.com calls “widgets,” which are mini-apps that will help you keep track of tasks, time or really anything you can think of. You’re presented with a few popular ones to get you started, but clicking on the “add widget” button will present you with a massive list.

The real power of dashboards is unlocked when you’re using several boards simultaneously.

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

#### How to Add Views to Monday.com

Views are charts and other graphical representations of the groups and tasks you have set out. They will help you see what needs to happen when, and even make adjustments on the fly. To add views to a board:

- go to the table view and click on the “main table” button at the top.
- From there, click on “+ add view” and another window will unfold with all your options
- If you click on “more views” at the bottom, the Views Center will load, and you get even more options

_Kanban View_:

Kanban boards are among the simplest yet most comprehensive ways to organize projects.

- To get it working on monday.com, just go back to our “views” list and click on “kanban.” The kanban view will immediately pop up
- To the right of the kanban board, you will find the settings for it, so whether you want to sort by status or person doing a task.
- To see a view, you need to check the “divide by groups” button at the right of the screen, below the column filters. However, this clutters the view...
- Another option is to use the “split view” button below “divide by groups” to give you both the kanban and the main table
- the great thing about the kanban view is that you can easily move tasks around by simply picking them up and dropping them into a new column

_Calendar_:

... which sorts your tasks by date and colors each task according to its group. It’s a great way to see what is due when.

- you can move tasks around in the calendar and the main table view will update accordingly, so if you see a date that doesn’t work for you, you can just move the task

_Other Views_:

- data-centric charts view, full project-management wizard, Gantt charts

</h3>

Trello is a kanban-based collaboration and task management tool that is perfect for all kinds of projects or teams. This tool is an all-around great fit for most projects as long as your needs are not financial in nature because Trello doesn’t come with any budgeting or invoicing features. In my opinion, Trello is the easiest to use project management software on the market considering its list of features and the level of convenience worked into its design.

#### 1. Setup your Trello project board and create task cards

Trello has a fantastic onboarding and setup process, so be sure to take full advantage of it with your first project. The setup process begins by filling in fields that’ll create your board lists. These lists are the steps of completion in the project.

These lists are where your tasks will live on the kanban board throughout the execution process. If at any point you have to add additional steps to your kanban board, all you have to do is scroll all the way to the right to create an additional list to move your task cards to.

#### 2. Create task cards and assign them to relevant team members

...it’s time to plan out your project and create the task cards...you can create tasks at any point in the workflow by clicking on the “Add another card” button at the bottom of any list. Otherwise, you’ll most likely add tasks to the first progress step on the kanban board.

Once you click on this button the new task window will appear on the screen, allowing you to fill in the relevant project details, such as:

- Due dates
- Card cover photos
- Descriptions
- Users
- Task comments
- Labels, which categorize and prioritize your tasks by team, importance, function, etc.
- Attachments, which can be files, images, documents, work breakdown structures, etc.

In order to give you a better sense of task progress, be sure to create a checklist in the card that’ll also display a percentage completion so you’ll never be left in the dark while tracking the execution.

Finally, you’ll want to add the team members responsible for these tasks to the card. All you have to do is click on “Members” on the right-hand menu while in any task window.

Once you’ve added them to the task, these users will receive all project notifications, including comments, changes, and every time a card is moved along from one step to the next.

#### 3. Move the Trello cards along the board as steps are completed

As you move through the execution phase of your project, all you’ll have to do is drag and drop your tasks into each step of the process from the planning phase to completion.

#### 4. Close out the project upon completion

Once you’ve completed all of the tasks in your project it’s time to close out your project and perform your post-project analysis to find out how your team did, what you learned, and what you could do better in the future...you can put together a post-project report to present to your team and the project stakeholders

#### Top 5 features for Trello project management

1. Kanban task management
2. Card search
3. Card cover photos
4. Automation functions
5. Task card checklists

</h3>

#### Visual Cues

- Assign members to Trello cards - who is responsible for this particular task so if anyone has questions, they know who to go to. There’s no point in having lots of tasks with no accountability.
- Use labels - Use the different coloured labels to easily categorise the cards however you choose. Whether that’s by its current progress status, the sprint name or the team it’s associated with. At a quick glance, this should help people to find or filter the exact cards they need with ease.
- Dates - How urgent is the task and when is it due? Having visible dates makes calendar view much easier, and can help prompt the rest of the team to start thinking about it or to help keep each other on track with timelines.
- Checklists - For those that like to plan down to the finer details, you’ll probably be using the checklists to tick off each micro-tasks. Not only will it help keep the person responsible on track but also help others see how far along you have gotten with that particular Trello card.

#### Export your Trello board for meetings

Cross-team communication is just as important as inter-team communication as it fosters information and idea-sharing, therefore, cultivating innovation. This is where [Board Export for Trello](https://www.orahapps.com/board-export-for-trello) becomes very handy. Give a snapshot in time update to stakeholders without drowning the meeting with details.

#### Thread comments in Trello for effective communication

In instances where you need someone else’s input or you want to keep another person updated, you’ll want to comment on your card to let the person know.

For those who are already regular users of Trello, you’ll find the comments section may not be as intuitive as you need it to be, especially if there are multiple points of discussion. And if you’re used to using something like Slack, then it definitely won’t be up to par as there’s no way to reply directly to specific comments, leaving you with a chaotic comments section.

[Threaded Comments for Trello](https://www.orahapps.com/threaded-comments-for-trello) is our recently released Power-Up that will help you and your team communicate with clarity. Gone are the days of stacked and confusing comments. You can now have multiple discussions within one card without spending lots of time deciphering which messages relate to which.

</h3>

Trello & Confluence used together make for better planning. You can use Confluence to craft an overarching vision, and Trello to organize that vision into bite-sized tasks.

#### How To Sync Trello And Confluence Together

The basic step is simple: go to the URL of your Trello card and copy it. Paste it onto a Confluence page. You should watch it to make sure it automatically renders a card once the page publishes. From there, still using Confluence, you can:

- View card and task statuses
- Comment on cards
- Subscribe for email updates on any changes
- Join cards
- View more info in the card just by clicking, which will take you into Trello—where you can edit the card, just like you’re used to doing

You can also paste a link directly into your Trello board and watch as it displays a new board tile. This tile gives you an overview of the link you pasted. From there, you can link any documentation you need with Confluence. If the team needs to update anything, they can easily do so within the tile on Trello.

#### Tips For Using Trello And Confluence Together

Here are some tips you can keep in mind:

- Put your files in Confluence. Trello’s kanban system is handy for reference, while you can use Confluence as a knowledge base for the major materials and files that govern your project. When it comes time to update a Trello card, anyone collaborating on the Trello board can do exactly that—and it will update to Confluence as well.
- Add your Trello board to the “project planning” stages. This way, anyone who needs to see where things stand can do so quickly. This gives them the total view: not only do they see the major milestones you’ve hit, but your current status with individual tasks in Trello.
- Create a “Trello board” macro within Confluence for a fully-interactive Trello board. Say you “miss” the experience you get from your Trello board. Good news: you don’t have to say goodbye! Just select the “+” sign and ‘Trello Board’ within Confluence, pasting in your board’s URL. You can choose the height of the board as it appears within Confluence, and voila—you’re looking at Trello within Confluence, almost like you have a window between two applications.

5 Foundational components to understanding Airtable

1. Everything is organized in Wordspaces

- a workspace is essentially a folder for databases
- free plan has unlimited DBs per workspace
- `Base` = database
- every workspace has its own paid tier - like having apps or more records
- Record count is the most common reason to upgrade
- you can have pro and free workspaces
- you can import data from Excel, Google Sheets, a CSV file, ...

Example:

- `Clients` > `Services` provided to the clients > `Invoices` for those clients
- So first build a clients table - that will give you a tab at the top
- like a spreadsheet, the columns are fields like client name, client address, client email, etc and each field accepts a certain data type
- you can delete the default fields/columns and add you own
- create more tables as you need them, e.g. "Services" with rows of Service 1, Service 2, etc
- you can link one table to another by typing the table name while in another table, e.g. typing Clients while in the Services table

**NOTE**: the leftmost field is called the "Primary Field" - basically an ID field so make sure it is unique for every record

#### Junction table

- how you want to link tables like to invoice clients
- at 14:30 create a table named "Invoice Detail" - link to "Services" and to "Invoices" and turn off "Allow multiple records" for both
- you want each record to represent a differeent line item on the invoice
- something about "grouping"

Lookups and Rollup field types

- "Lookup" a price which lives in the Services table - `Lookup` is the field type you want to use
- "Rollup": used to sum individual line items in an invoice to get the total for the invoice

> You need `{ }` if your frield name has spaces

Formulas:

1.  `CONCATENATE({var1}, ' ', {var2})`:
2.  `SUM(values)`:
