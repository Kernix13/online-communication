# Design collaboration tools

1. Figma
1. Lunacy
1. Penpot
1. Sketch
1. InVision

I'll provide links for Sketch and InVision but Figma is the best option. There are other design resources, but you can't go wrong with Figma.

## Designing in Figma

The free plan allows having projects and team members. I am not sure of how many members but at least you can collaborate. You can also invite members to review prototype designs and leave sticky note comments. You can even go into Observation mode and watch your teammates comment and make edits.

That is about the extent of collaboration with the free plan but it still offers the ability to share and contribute to projects.

The best links I found are from Figma's channel on YouTube. Here are the best videos:

## InVision

LINKS: I'm only interested in using Figma so I did not do any research on InVision, but check out their [YouTube channel playlists](https://www.youtube.com/c/Invisionappinc/playlists) for tutorials on the tool.

## Sketch

Sketch is only free if you are a student or teacher
